> [!narration] First sight
> The wolfrabbit crosses open ground in two bounds, and each landing swings the raking claws almost before its feet touch down. It gathers low before every spring, so you can read each leap before it comes. When one of them falls bleeding, the pack closes on the scent and the frenzy starts there.

## Play

### Tactics

Open from its preferred terrain, announce the tell of its strongest option, and let the Party answer with positioning, cover, or focused fire. It retreats when its preferred advantage is gone or it is badly wounded.

### Outside a fight

Its tracks, feeding signs, and territorial behaviour warn the Party before an encounter. It acts according to its habitat and does not pursue beyond the terrain that gives it an advantage.

## Depth

### Ecology

The World is its habitat. Its diet follows its form. Observant travellers can identify its signs with Wisdom (Survival).

### Hidden truths

A careful examination of its remains or territory reveals its habits and weaknesses. A successful relevant Intelligence check confirms them.
