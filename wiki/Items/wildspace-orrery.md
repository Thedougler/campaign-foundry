### Properties

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon.*

Inside a Wildspace system, this portable arcane device automatically tracks the positions and movements of all suns, planets, moons, and comets within that system, projecting a display of all these bodies in the space above its current location. In that display, a white, pulsating pinprick of light marks the orrery's location.
