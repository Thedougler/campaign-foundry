## At a Glance

Vantyrus is the hand behind Skarn: the master of the [[Countless]], who sent his apprentice for Crissdalynn's [[fate-spinner]] and has not yet shown himself.

- **Role.** Master of [[Countless|the Countless]], and the party's rival.
- **Nature.** An aged snowy-owl aarakocra, once a senior master of the [[high-eyrie|High Eyrie]] and teacher of [[master-kyzil]].
- **Wants.** The [[soul-incarnate|Soul Incarnate]]'s transformation technique. The crack he means to use is [[crissdalynn-khinriss]]'s unexplained gift.
- **Home.** None fixed. He moves along the Countless's Midchain routes.

**Identity.** [[osset]] is his original name. He now goes by Talon Vantyrus as leader of [[Countless|the Countless]], and **Talon** is a title his agents share.

> [!narration] Talon Vantyrus
> Feathers the color of old snow cover him shoulder to talon, bled past white by age and altitude both, with black mottling breaking the pale field across his brow and wing coverts. Cold air off the heights clings to him, carrying a faint tang of frost. His eyes are yellow-gold and he watches without blinking. His robes keep the layered construction of Sentinel martial dress and have been stripped of every identifying mark, and a thin blade hangs balanced at his hip beside the crystal top he turns while he thinks. When he finally moves, it costs him nothing, one wing folding tighter to his back, the only warning a lesser argument gets before he ends it.

## At the Table

- **First meeting.** He arrives as Talon Vantyrus, master of the Countless, and opens on the work in front of them, never on himself. He never offers his original name. If someone says "Osset" aloud, he stops deciding whether to answer and starts deciding whether to stay.
- **Opens up when.** A plea stops immediate harm, or an argument accepts the cost of acting.
- **Shuts down when.** Anyone appeals to patience, procedure, tradition, or doctrine instead of action, or the talk turns into an interrogation. He leaves.
- **Shares.** His doctrine, freely. Never his name, [[talon-skarn]]'s real standing, or how he means to reach [[crissdalynn-khinriss]].
- **Lines.** "You may sit. You already know what I am asking, or you would not be here." · "Nothing had to happen. Something happened, and afterward you invented inevitability so you could survive having done nothing." · "Tell me the difference between a preventable death and a permitted one."
- **He has not yet appeared.** He stays off-screen until the party can learn that he is Osset.

**Voice.** Composed, quiet, and precise. He never raises his voice and rarely repeats himself, and he speaks like a teacher who expects the student to eventually understand.

He does not describe his foresight as destiny. His vocabulary is *avoidable*, *preventable*, *consequence*, *probability*, *intervention*, and *waste*, and he despises any claim that something "had to happen."

* "Nothing had to happen. Something happened, and afterward you invented inevitability so you could survive having done nothing."
* "You mistake stillness for mercy. It has never been mercy."
* "You crossed an ocean because watching was not enough. Do not pretend we disagree about intervention."
* "Tell me the difference between a preventable death and a permitted one."
* "Your heel."

**Doctrine.** Vantyrus broke from the [[sentinels-of-the-eyrie]] because the order **recorded deaths without preventing them**. The [[high-eyrie|Eyrie]] records time, weather, position, water, occurrence, and loss, and its discipline demands observation without interference. Vantyrus came to regard that restraint as complicity, and his answer became the [[Countless]].

| Order | Practice |
| --- | --- |
| [[sentinels-of-the-eyrie]] | Complete record, no action. |
| [[Countless]] | Complete action, no record. |

Countless erases names, passes orders through intermediaries, and hands hired blades one task each, so losses disappear from the ledger. Vantyrus believes knowledge creates responsibility and states the principle without softening it: "If you knew enough to record the death, you knew enough to try."

His corruption lies in how far he carries that principle. Given enough foresight, every choice becomes something to optimize. Chance becomes negligence. Freedom becomes another variable capable of producing unacceptable outcomes.

## Statblock

**Combat.** Vantyrus's build is [[master-kyzil]]'s disciplined Kensei form carried toward prediction, interruption, and control, and the two share that lineage from before their break. His win condition is a decision he can make for the party, not a body count, and he withdraws rather than stands when the exchange turns against him.

```

**Running the fight.** Vantyrus should feel like he is **interrupting decisions rather than absorbing attacks**, and he should rarely stand and trade damage. Roll his three **Fatespinner** dice openly at the beginning of combat and leave them visible: a low stored roll becomes a threat hanging over the party, and a high roll becomes an outcome he can guarantee for himself or an ally.

1. Hold position behind **Winter's Stillness** until the action begins.
2. Spend **Fatespinner** to ruin a critical roll.
3. Make three **Frostglass Blade** attacks.
4. Reposition through **Between Wingbeats**, **Flowing Step**, or **Unchosen Step**.
5. Answer weapon pressure with **Absent Feather** and a key spell with **Sever the Gesture**.
6. Spend **Five Futures Cut** once the party spreads out or believes distance has made them safe.

**The Fatespinner.** The [[fate-spinner]] does not show him a single predetermined future. It exposes nearby possibilities, and he uses it to find the moments where several outcomes remain possible and then forces one branch to become real. At the table that is the **Fatespinner** trait above. Describe his effects as impossible prediction, wing-assisted footwork, temporal afterimages, strikes intercepted before they begin, movements selected from several possible futures, and the Fatespinner rotating as outcomes collapse. None of them is spellcasting.

* **Absent Feather.** The attack passes through the version of Vantyrus the attacker expected to hit.
* **Fatespinner.** The dreidel turns once and an already-rolled possibility becomes real.
* **Five Futures Cut.** Several translucent Vantyruses begin different attacks simultaneously. Only one remains when the movement ends.
* **Binding Grasp.** Every direction the target tries to move briefly produces the same image of Vantyrus already waiting there.
* **Sever the Gesture.** He strikes the wrist, wing, breath, focus, or exact moment required to complete the spell.

## Secrets

- **Osset is Talon Vantyrus.** The party does not know it, and [[master-kyzil]] believes his old master died decades ago. Vantyrus still counts Kyzil his greatest student. His only admitted fear is that [[talon-skarn]] may be right.
- **Why he wants the Spinner.** Kyzil gave Crissdalynn her [[fate-spinner]], and it bonded to her. Through it, Vantyrus means to read what Kyzil taught her, and what Kyzil refused to teach her, and so find the way into the Soul Incarnate's technique. That is why he sent Skarn.
- **Where he is.** Somewhere on the Countless's Midchain routes. The Countless probe through the [[drowned-maw]] seal failed, and he is planning another.
- **If he gains the technique.** He gets a second statblock, in which he moves from seeing several possible futures to existing across several at once. His current statblock carries no Soul Incarnate abilities.

**Weakness of Long Sight.** Vantyrus does not see an authored future. He sees probable ones, and his read weakens whenever people act without preparation, irrationally, for reasons he does not understand, against their own obvious interests, through genuine self-sacrifice, or in deliberate coordination with chaos and uncertainty. A creature who willingly accepts a terrible consequence to preserve another person's freedom violates the premise beneath his whole philosophy, and he has trouble predicting it. His greatest blind spot is treating people as solvable systems.

**Goals and fronts.** Vantyrus wants the transformation technique of the [[soul-incarnate|Soul Incarnate]], and his route runs through [[crissdalynn-khinriss]]. He anchors the [[rule-of-two]], the [[long-sight-hunt]], [[countless-through-the-maw-seal]], [[sentinels-and-countless]], [[schisms-third-name]], and [[soul-incarnates-watch]].

* **Front: The Rule of Two.** *Lifecycle:* active. *Aim:* stay ahead of [[talon-skarn]]'s open contest to kill him long enough to pry the transformation technique loose from the order that raised him, whatever it costs the people still inside it. *Approach:* he gives Skarn access to every technique and treats each lesson as a live weapon aimed back at him, never announces the test, and never deliberately teaches Skarn anything wrong. If Skarn cannot eventually threaten him, Vantyrus considers himself to have failed as a master. Every other task runs through hired blades and paid contacts who learn one job each and never who gave the order. *Off-screen move if unopposed:* keeps testing Skarn's reach while advancing the Countless's hunt for that gift, the shared operation on [[long-sight-hunt]]. *Closes when:* Skarn's move against him becomes more pressing than one fight, or Kyzil realizing what Crissdalynn is holding closes the one crack Vantyrus is counting on. *Clock:* 4 segments, fast-moving once Skarn commits. Filled: 0. *Consequence at fill:* the contest resolves, and Vantyrus falls to his own apprentice or breaks Skarn decisively and preserves the Rule of Two for a generation. *Possible outcomes:* Skarn strikes and loses, proving Vantyrus's doctrine again; Skarn strikes and wins and the Countless gains a new master; or the fight turns against Vantyrus directly and he escapes through **Unchosen Step**, leaving a hired hand or Skarn to cover the gap while the contest continues another day. *PC connection:* runs through [[crissdalynn-khinriss]] directly, because his whole plan is to read what she is carrying before Kyzil or the order realize what she holds. *Quest link:* none yet.

## Connections

| Connection | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| [[osset]] | Original name. This page is the live alias and current identity. |
| [[master-kyzil]] | His most gifted student at [[high-eyrie]], who refused to leave the order with him and now believes his old master is decades dead. Vantyrus does not primarily want Kyzil dead; he wants Kyzil to finally admit that watching was not enough. |
| [[talon-skarn]] | His apprentice and eventual executioner, prepared by design under the [[rule-of-two]]. Their contest for Vantyrus's life remains open, and neither has called it off. |
| [[crissdalynn-khinriss]] | Unaware target. Her unexplained [[long-sight\|Long Sight]] is the one crack in whatever protects the [[soul-incarnate\|Soul Incarnate]] technique. He wants to know what Kyzil taught her, and more importantly what Kyzil refused to teach her. |
| [[sentinels-of-the-eyrie]] | The order he broke from over that old rift with Kyzil. He works against it now. |
| [[Countless]] | The order he leads now, built on the Sentinels' own reach with none of its restraint. |
| [[fate-spinner]] | A divinatory focus he carries and a weapon against probability itself. |
