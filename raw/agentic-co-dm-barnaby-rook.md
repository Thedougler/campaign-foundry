## At a Glance

| **Role**   | Crown privateer captain |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| **Nature** | A hard boarding officer who speaks in commands and uses fear when surrender does not come. |
| **Home**   | The inspection corridor between the [[crown-islands]] and the [[central-strait]], aboard the HCS Surety |
| **Wants**  | To choke every irregular captain out of the [[calders-tooth-and-port-tidefall]] corridor for the [[dravosi-crown]], now narrowed to hunting defectors and surrenders. |
| **Leverage** | Crown authority, [[letters-of-marque]], a crew of [[dravosi-deckhand|Dravosi Deckhands]], and a reputation for shooting turncoats. |
| **Limit**  | His crew defected or died, and he was last seen in dark water after being knocked from the Surety's rigging twice. |

> **DM thesis:** Rook is the Crown's tightening grip made personal: a controlled boarding captain who treats surrender and defection as different kinds of betrayal.

> [!narration] Barnaby Rook
> A hard privateer captain stands on the deck in a Crown coat gone salt-stiff at the shoulders. He speaks in flat statements rather than conversation, each one a command. His weapon stays ready without flourish. The threat is quiet, almost administrative, until someone refuses him; then the quiet turns lethal.

## Running Barnaby Rook

### First meeting

Rook boards under colour of law and expects weaker captains to surrender before violence begins. In Session 01 he stayed on the [[Saltwright]]'s deck while [[beaumont-sel|Beaumont]] distracted the crew below. When the last [[dravosi-deckhand]] dropped his sword, Rook called out, *“I'll shoot you myself for that, you turncoat.”*
```

### When posture changes

Rook pivots from inspection to fear when talk fails. He shows no hesitation about shooting crew members for defection. He replaced [[norrington-kingsly]] as the harder choice around Tidefall, pursuing names, contraband, and compliant captains where his predecessor negotiated routine fees.

In Session 02, after his crew had died or defected, Rook retook the Surety alone. [[delmar-fisk|Delmar]] knocked him from the rigging into the water twice; something long and eel-like swam near him, and he did not resurface. He is presumed dead, though his death may not have reached [[rupert-knighton]].
```

## Voice

Rook speaks in flat statements, not conversation. Each sentence is a command. Threat is silent, never loud, and turns lethal in moments.

**The ask:** *“Surrender before this becomes unpleasant.”*

**The refusal:** *“Your papers do not change the order.”*

**Under pressure:** *“I'll shoot you myself for that, you turncoat.”*

**Campaign history.**

He runs the inspection and shakedown campaign around Tidefall. The Crown chain runs through [[Dorian Bishop]] to [[rupert-knighton]], and Rook serves as their tool, answering to both. He works the same corridor [[commander-gideon-ault]]'s [[hcs-warrant]] patrols from [[harwick]], with Crown authority stacked two ships deep along that water.

At the [[Saltwright]], Jean-Claude hit Rook with the [[Flask of Endless Water]] at the gangplank and threw him back; Rook got up and fired at [[beaumont-sel|Beaumont]], whose plate deflected the shot. In Session 02, Crissdalynn bent his flintlock shot with her wind and caught the follow-up on her bracers, while [[beaumont-sel|Beaumont]] threw [[Bisou]] through a gun port to handle the cannon. Crissdalynn later fished his hat out with a boat hook.

The crew searched his cabin and cargo, finding 45 gp, [[letters-of-marque]], and a blunderbuss in the cabin; 110 gp and two garnets under the floor; and a pendant marked *For Mira, from the sea*. A crate held flintlocks, Mira's Blade, and twenty vials of [[Grung]] poison. Mira's Blade went to [[perrin-black-jaw|Perrin]].

Rook held captive a [[Moucheron]] named Ket as “a specimen,” driven by curiosity about the [[five-blades]] mercenaries operating out of [[kalowe]]. The crew freed Ket, who ate and flew home to [[murrat]]. The tincture ties Rook to [[simone-tabarnack]]'s supply chain; the crew does not yet know the full connection.

  - desc: "Arm the Guns. Rook orders the gun crew to uncover the hatches of the Surety's two deck-level cannons and ready them for firing. No immediate effect — the guns are primed. This enables Fire the Guns on the following round."
  - desc: "Fire the Guns. If the Surety's cannons were Armed last round, Rook commands both gun crews to fire. Each cannon discharges in a 30-foot cone extending from its gun port along the deck. Each creature or object in either cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half on a success. Structures and objects in either cone automatically take the full damage."
  - desc: "Call to Arms. If Rook has been reduced below half his hit point maximum (60 hp), he calls out to all remaining crew aboard the Surety. Up to 1d4+1 Dravosi Deckhands appear at the start of Rook's next turn in unoccupied spaces aboard the Surety."
```

CR 3 boarding specialist and Phase 3 boss of the Saltwright with lair actions aboard the HCS Surety. Rook fights flat and controlled, absorbing hits and regrouping without escalating.

With two or more allies near, Officer's Advantage helps him in initiative and resists surprise. Without allies, Cornered Wolf makes him dangerous alone. His Parry and saves get better.

Naval Footwork lets him move away and disengage without cost. He repositions or reloads as needed. A clean [[knock]] off his footing costs him that disengage outright, and [[delmar-fisk|Delmar]] used exactly that to put him in the water twice. Aboard the Surety, his lair actions transform the ship into a weapon. One round spent on Arm the Guns prepares Fire the Guns the following round. Dropping him below half HP triggers Call to Arms.
