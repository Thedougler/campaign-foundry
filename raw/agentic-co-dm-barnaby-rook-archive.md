# Barnaby Rook

![[barnaby-rook-banner]]
![[barnaby-rook-portrait]]

**Wants:** to choke every irregular captain out of the [[tidefall|Tidefall]] corridor for the [[dravosi-crown|Dravosi Crown]], narrowed since his fall off the Surety's rigging to running down the crew who defected or surrendered under him.

The face of the Crown's tightening grip on [[tidefall|Tidefall]], Rook is a hard [[dravosi-crown|Dravosi Crown]] privateer captain who boards under colour of law and expects weaker captains to surrender before violence begins. When talk fails, he pivots to fear.

He speaks in flat statements, not conversation. Each one is a command. He absorbs hits and comes back stronger. Threat is silent, never loud. It turns lethal in moments. He shows no hesitation about shooting crew members for defection.

He runs the inspection and shakedown campaign around Tidefall, replacing [[norrington-kingsly|Norrington Kingsly]] as the harder choice. Where his predecessor negotiated routine fees, Rook pursues names, contraband, and compliant captains, and he recognizes betrayal instantly: when Geoffrey surrendered at the [[saltwright|Saltwright]], Rook knew at once. The Crown chain runs through [[dorian-bishop|Dorian Bishop]] to [[rupert-knighton|Rupert Knighton]], and Rook serves as their tool, answering to both. He works the inspection corridor between the [[crown-islands|Crown Islands]] and the [[central-strait|Central Strait]], the same stretch [[commander-gideon-ault|Commander Gideon Ault]]'s [[hcs-warrant|HCS Warrant]] patrols out of [[harwick|Harwick]], with Crown authority stacked two ships deep along that water, and he crews the Surety with [[dravosi-deckhand|Dravosi Deckhands]].

He was first met in Session 01, boarding the Saltwright. Rook stayed on deck while [[beaumont-sel|Beaumont]] distracted the crew below. When the last [[dravosi-deckhand|Dravosi Deckhand]] dropped his sword, Rook called out: *"I'll shoot you myself for that, you turncoat."* Jean-Claude hit him with the [[flask|Flask of Endless Water]] at the gangplank and threw him back, but he got up and fired at [[beaumont-sel|Beaumont]]. Her plate deflected the shot. The session ended with him alone and furious.

In Session 02, Rook retook the Surety alone, though his crew had either died or defected, including [[geoffrey-draves|Geoffrey Draves]]. Crissdalynn bent his flintlock shot with her wind and caught the follow-up on her bracers, while [[beaumont-sel|Beaumont]] threw [[bisou|Bisou]] through a gun port to handle the cannon. Delmar knocked Rook from the rigging into the water twice, wind-thrown chairs both times. Something long and eel-like swam near him in the dark water, and he didn't resurface. Presumed dead. Crissdalynn fished his hat out with a boat hook.

The crew searched his cabin and cargo, finding 45 gp, [[letters-of-marque|Letters of Marque]], and a blunderbuss in the cabin, plus 110 gp and two garnets under the floor, and a pendant marked *For Mira, from the sea*. A crate held flintlocks, Mira's Blade, and twenty vials of [[grung|Grung]] poison that Jean-Claude knew from the Alchemist in Session 01. Mira's Blade went to [[perrin-black-jaw|Perrin]].

Rook held captive a [[moucheron|Moucheron]] named Ket as "a specimen," driven by curiosity about the [[five-blades|Five Blades]] mercenaries who operate out of [[kalowe|Kalowe]]. The crew freed Ket, who ate and flew home to [[murrat|Murrat]].

The tincture ties him to [[simone-tabarnack|Simone Tabarnack]]'s supply chain. The same Grung poison reached him as a privateer. The crew doesn't yet know the full connection. His death may not have reached Rupert Knighton up the Crown chain.

  - desc: "Arm the Guns. Rook orders the gun crew to uncover the hatches of the Surety's two deck-level cannons and ready them for firing. No immediate effect — the guns are primed. This enables Fire the Guns on the following round."
  - desc: "Fire the Guns. If the Surety's cannons were Armed last round, Rook commands both gun crews to fire. Each cannon discharges in a 30-foot cone extending from its gun port along the deck. Each creature or object in either cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half on a success. Structures and objects in either cone automatically take the full damage."
  - desc: "Call to Arms. If Rook has been reduced below half his hit point maximum (60 hp), he calls out to all remaining crew aboard the Surety. Up to 1d4+1 Dravosi Deckhands appear at the start of Rook's next turn in unoccupied spaces aboard the Surety."
```

CR 3 boarding specialist and Phase 3 boss of the Saltwright with lair actions aboard the HCS Surety. Rook fights flat and controlled, absorbing hits and regrouping without escalating.

With two or more allies near, Officer's Advantage helps him in initiative and resists surprise. Without allies, Cornered Wolf makes him dangerous alone. His Parry and saves get better.

Naval Footwork lets him move away and disengage without cost. He repositions or reloads as needed. A clean [[knock|knock]] off his footing costs him that disengage outright, and [[delmar-fisk|Delmar]] used exactly that to put him in the water twice. Aboard the Surety, his lair actions transform the ship into a weapon. One round spent on Arm the Guns prepares Fire the Guns the following round. Dropping him below half HP triggers Call to Arms.
