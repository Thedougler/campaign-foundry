*Polished enforcer in tailored silk, Nona Black-Jaw's personal bodyguard and the quietest threat in any room.*

**Wants:** to stay alert, catching every threat before it reaches Nona.

**Quote:** "Nona asked you a question."

> [!narration] Narration
> Black jaguar [[Tabaxi]], compact and solid, face composed and watchful. Ears alert to track the room. A long pale scar cuts from his left cheekbone down to his jaw, an old wound standing out against the obsidian of his fur. Dark tailored suit with collar buttoned tight, shoes mirror-polished to a shine. Claws filed and gleaming. He stands slightly behind and to Nona's right, weight on his back foot, one hand always free while the other passes bread and dried fish to whoever comes close, reading each face as it takes from him.

**Roleplay Concept:** polished mob enforcer + attentive bodyguard.

**Opening move:** flanking Nona as she passes bread and fish to the crew gathered at the crater's rim · Enzo speaks first · "You should take some. Long day ahead."

**Lore Sheet:** bodyguard to **Nona Black-Jaw**, working out of [[le-paludi]] and [[warren|The Warren]]. Reads every guest for threats and intentions through micro-gestures and silence. Uses a lit cigar as a timer for Nona's patience. If it burns too low while she waits for an answer, he unsheathes one claw. More comfortable with violence than with people.

**Toy Chest**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary goal | Keep Nona alive and aware, reading every guest for threats and lies. |
| Consistent method | Communicates through silence and small signals: tap of ash, weight shift, glance, or claw. |
| Active problem | The raid brought new faces to the [[Mercatura]] and new guards to the quays. One person cannot read everyone at once. |
| Performance hooks | Polished enforcer vibe. Taps his cigar ash against the table rim to mark conversation rhythm. |
| Link of relevance | Arranged safe passage and consolation for [[perrin-black-jaw]]'s surviving crew on Nona's order (Session 03). |

**Voice & Delivery:** never raises his voice, speaking with complete politeness regardless of message. "Nona asked you a question" lands as threat or favor depending on context. Holds doors and pulls chairs, reading crew like a banker reads a ledger while signaling to Nona with ash taps and weight shifts. Comfortable with violence, prefers it to talk.
