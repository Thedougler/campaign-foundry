# Master Kyzil

![[master-kyzil-banner.webp]]
![[master-kyzil-portrait.webp]]

**Wants:** confirm Crissdalynn's readiness and account for the two Sentinels the Maw took, while something foul stirs beneath Calveno and pulls his attention in two directions at once.

![[master-kyzil-narration-appearance]]

*Kyzil*: "I corrected course. Three times."

Senior master of the [[sentinels-of-the-eyrie|Sentinels of the Eyrie]], an [[aarakocra|Aarakocra]] built and coloured like a barn owl, stationed out of [[high-eyrie|High Eyrie]] and currently in [[calveno|Calveno]] since Day 2 of Session 03. A disciplined guardian who masks his anxiety beneath perfect composure: he asks questions instead of giving orders, and channels worry into action instead of words.

He gave [[crissdalynn-khinriss|Crissdalynn]] her pilgrimage himself: map [[the-drowned-maw|The Drowned Maw]] from inside a storm, the hardest assignment on record, staking his own reputation on her readiness. When the [[red-lady|Red Lady]] went down, he tracked her by current and weather, predicted where she'd wash ashore, and went to [[tidefall|Port Tidefall]] to wait, then learned the ship had sunk. He searched east into the [[midchain|Midchain]] first, then west, after a maritime contact spotted an Aarakocra monk aboard a captured Crown patrol cutter.

Before any of that, Kyzil had his own master at High Eyrie, a teacher who came to see the order's "record without conclusion" doctrine as people dying in front of an order that only ever wrote it down, broke from the Sentinels over it, and asked Kyzil to break with him too, though Kyzil refused, and neither has stopped believing he was right since. The old master never actually died, though, and he's now [[talon-vantyrus|Talon Vantyrus]], master of [[the-countless|the Countless]], a fact Kyzil doesn't know.

In Calveno, he's taking his meal on the Waveservant Shrine steps, gaze fixed on something distant across the square, the step beside him left conspicuously empty. He doesn't speak first, and waits for Crissdalynn to break the silence, if she will.

With Crissdalynn specifically, he's told her the pilgrimage isn't over. He won't say how. In Calveno he asks about the course of her pilgrimage instead of a confession, wanting two things: what she saw and recorded, and what the Maw did to test her. The storm shifted winds and tides beyond her prediction, breaking the currents she tried to follow. It bent her compass and demanded courage she had to find. Why he was close enough to hear of the wreck, and what business of his own he has in the region, stay unknown, though his assignment for her is on record and his motives for tracking her personally are not.

He asks questions instead of making statements, even while teaching, and agrees when he wants to apply pressure, letting a student's self-criticism sit as a flat "Yes" and nothing more. He stops before the emotional word: "I corrected course." "Three times." That's all he gives. Wind and tide are his vocabulary for relationships, and when his composure threatens to crack, he smooths his robes, refolds his wings right over left, then adjusts his hood, a tell those who know him catch once, one he doesn't know shows.

The "foul wind from the south" he named when the ship went down was right: Talon Vantyrus and [[talon-skarn|Talon Skarn]] of [[the-countless|the Countless]] were operating in the Midchain at the time, a thread to introduce once the crew of the [[uncertainty|Uncertainty]] actually travels into or reaches the Midchain, not before. His own outstanding business: determine what the Eyrie needs to know about current Maw conditions, and whatever brought him to Calveno beyond Crissdalynn, which he hasn't said. Does he know about the [[soul-incarnate-statblock|Soul Incarnate]]? No: per Sentinels of the Eyrie doctrine, he doesn't know the [[soul-incarnate|Soul Incarnate]] exists as a conscious entity, only that the order's founding documents are ancient.

- [[talon-vantyrus|Talon Vantyrus]]: his old master at [[high-eyrie|High Eyrie]]. Kyzil believes he departed the order decades ago. He has no idea Vantyrus is alive, active, or leading [[the-countless|the Countless]] now.

- Crissdalynn's Pilgrimage: the task he assigned her
- [[calveno|Calveno]]: present location
- [[jean-claude-tabarnack|Jean-Claude Tabarnack]]: dismissed as “no threat”; tension established
- [[delmar-fisk|Delmar Fisk]]: bear-hugged Kyzil on meeting; joined the spar uninvited

- [[ponte-bassa|Ponte Bassa]]: spar location

## Session Log

**Session 07** (`vault/episodes/007/`): flew into the Calveno crater fight after Delmar's whistle. Threw four edge dancer daggers a turn, all hitting, and dropped one of [[otar-the-foul|Otar the Foul]]'s [[minor-slaad|Minor Slaad]] minions in one attack for 67 damage. Took a Dodge action on a later turn and killed two more Minor Slaad with ease. Source: [[transcript]].

**Session 06** (`vault/episodes/006/`): led a rooftop chase across [[le-paludi|Le Paludi]] during [[il-gioco-delle-beffe|Il Gioco delle Beffe]]. He batted away a water balloon, picked through a flower/balloon/net barrage, and wasn't fooled by a boy's fake drowning.

**Session 03** (`vault/episodes/003/`): reunited with [[crissdalynn-khinriss|Crissdalynn]] in the Le Paludi streets. He dove from the sun in silence, knocked her back twenty feet, and held her from the front. She recognized his smell before seeing him. Had searched [[kalowe|Kalowe]] and [[tidefall|Tidefall]] first. Said "a foul wind from the south." Party currently unaware of his broader context.

**Session 04** (`vault/episodes/004/`): told Crissdalynn he gave her the hardest pilgrimage in Eyrie history because he knew she could do it. Maw has been unruly and dangerous since the wreck. Weather odd. Sentinels saw the wreck. Senses something foul from the south.

Challenged them to a nonlethal four-on-one spar on the [[ponte-bassa|Ponte Bassa]] rooftop: he turned edges, caught falls on the wind, and dropped a student cleanly instead of maiming them. Crissdalynn wrestled him R1 (natural 1 on the contest). Downburst legendary action broke the hold. First attempt stopped by bardic inspiration, second knocked her off the roof. He panicked and flew down to catch her.

Pinned Jean-Claude's shirt to a chair with a returning dagger as a dominance display (Jean-Claude wasn't participating). Delmar landed a sneak attack through Empty Wing Parry via bardic inspiration for 17 damage. He held as designed for three rounds. Kyzil ended standing.

Staying in Calveno through the festival. Afterward, investigated his “foul wind” instinct overnight. Heard fragments about small cloaked figures near storm drains and acidic smells underground. Instinct confirmed: something is moving beneath Calveno. He's primed to snap into tactical assessment once they share their intel.

- **Spar tactics:** opening: “I'd like to show you something. Please try to hit me.” Routine: Multiattack (4 attacks, pulling edges) → Patient Defense → Empty Wing Parry on incoming hits. Round 3: updraft step to elevated position, full pressure. Cutting Gale used when two or more PCs stood in a line (“He exhales” was the warning). Win condition offered: force his Legendary [[resistance-spell|Resistance]] or trigger his Empty Wing Parry; land a hit after baiting movement or shield an ally as a gale fires; disarm him or use terrain to block his approach. Kyzil still ends standing. Ending: Kyzil stops, not them. He catches a weapon or fist mid-swing, holds it one beat before saying “There.” When cutting Gale fired down the line with Crissdalynn in it, she proved herself: she moved. “You moved. Good.” was all he said.
