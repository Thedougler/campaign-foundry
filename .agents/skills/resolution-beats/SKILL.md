# Resolution beats

A Resolution is the **tag line**: a tiny afterscene where the session's ends
are tied off, or the sequel shows its face. It is the result of every beat
before it — threads planted in the Hook and middle at their final state,
costs visible, rewards in hand — and it is proportional to the Climax. It can
overturn the Climax's apparent result when the overturn grows from
established fiction.

## Gates

**Session plan first.** Before reading further or loading any other skill,
find this session's filed plan (`Session-<NN>-00-*.md` in its session
folder). With none, stop here: load `plan-session` and plan with the DM;
this skill resumes from the plan's row once `session-beats` files it.

Prep only. Follow `docs/agents/work.md`. Follow AGENTS.md **HARD: entity-before-spoken** and **HARD: dm-facing-explicit**.
Cast and invent per `docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting and § Fill the silence.

## Boundary contract

- **Input:** A named Resolution beat, the Climax's outcome rows and
  carry-forward, the session's threads and costs, and linked owner pages.
- **Session plan:** the short form of the DM's intent for the session; this
  beat is written from its row (see Gates).
- **Work:** Build one Resolution to the table-ready bar with the Resolution
  craft below; spoken text is filled through `theatre-of-the-mind`.
- **Done:** The cold read passes and the completion test holds for every
  Climax outcome the Resolution answers.
- **Capability Handoff:** Return the Resolution page and the aftermath state.
  `session-beats` owns the next session's chart; a named entity goes to its
  wiki-kind owner; a missing entry fact returns as a named gap.

## Copy-start

Copy `wiki/templates/resolution.md`. File after accept to `wiki/journal/sessions/<campaign-slug>/<session-number>/Session-<n>-<BB>-<Label>.md`; when the request names no session, list `wiki/journal/sessions/<campaign-slug>/`, take the next session to be played, and say so. Keep the sections the template marks `Required.` and every section this Resolution spends at the table; delete the rest (fact-only, `wiki/AGENTS.md` Layout). Add no section the template lacks: refiling an older page moves each old section's facts into the template section that owns them (fighter numbers and tactics into Actors, pressure into Situation or Pressure where the template has it).

## Fill a Resolution

1. **Ground.** Read the Climax's outcome rows and carry-forward, the session
   plan's threads and PC touchpoints, each beat's costs, and the owner pages
   for the people, places, and items in the afterscene (retrieve with `qmd`).
   Done when each thread's final state and each cost paid are listed.
2. **Choose the card per outcome.** Read
   [references/resolution-cards.md](references/resolution-cards.md). For each
   Climax outcome the Resolution answers, pick the card that outcome produced. The card goes in the beat's frontmatter `card:`; the page body carries only what it produces.
3. **Cast owners.** Every named person, place, item, or faction in the
   afterscene has an owner page before any text depends on it: cast from the
   wiki first, and mint only what nothing fits (`docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting).
4. **Read the bar.** Read `docs/agents/table-ready.md`, then build every
   anatomy part the afterscene spends, applying the Resolution craft below.
   Write every DM-facing line with `writing-for-humans`: each fact on the
   page has a moment of use and one home, and what the wiki holds is embedded.
5. **Set rewards and rulings.** Name every reward and its owner; load
   `dnd5e-mechanics` for any check, and `item-design` for a new
   magic item.
6. **Fill the spoken layer.** Load `theatre-of-the-mind` and fill the
   `[!narration] Closing Image` block under the Previous beat line for each
   outcome branch (a callout per branch, titled with the outcome, not a table
   column), and `Next Hook` when one grows from
   play: the arrival, sign, or message the characters perceive, ending before
   anyone can act. Delete a slot that has no spoken text.
7. **Record the aftermath.** Fill Consequences (what is different now, what
   cannot be restored, and what each open thread becomes) and Rewards, so the
   next session's planner reads the changed world from this page.
8. **Cold read.** Run the cold read from `docs/agents/table-ready.md` and the
   completion test. Fix every gap before filing.

## Resolution craft

- **Short and proportional.** About ten to twenty-five minutes of table time. A
  personal-stakes Climax gets a personal afterscene; a faction-scale Climax
  gets a power-vacuum afterscene. New fights, new villains, and new
  worldbuilding belong to the next session.
- **Branch by outcome.** When the Climax could end several ways, the page
  carries a branch per outcome — held or lost, captured or escaped — each
  with its own closing image, costs, and rewards.
- **Costs stay paid.** Lost allies stay lost; spent supplies stay spent;
  injuries and broken trust show in the scene. Convenient survivals and
  arriving merchants erase what the Climax proved.
- **Rewards are named.** Coin with amounts, items with owner links, XP or the
  milestone, favors and titles with who grants them, faction standing with
  its effect.
- **Echo the arc.** The Hook's question gets its answer; each thread gets
  Close, Carry, or Transform; each PC's touchpoint gets a closing moment,
  framed as a prompt the player answers.
- **Grounded overturns.** A reversal of the Climax's result — the villain's
  escape craft, the rescued ally changed by captivity — uses means planted
  earlier and names that beat. A threat with no roots belongs in the next
  session's Hook.
- **One door forward.** End on one clear next vector, or plain closure. An
  Ending Cliffhanger or Greater Threat card is that one door, chosen because
  the Climax's outcome exposed it.

## Completion test

Players can name what is different and what they want next; every Climax
outcome the page answers shows its costs, rewards, and thread states; and the
aftermath records are complete enough for the next session's plan. On the
page:

- each outcome's rewards are named with values: the loot the defeated side
  carried (owner links), coin amounts, favors and access with who grants
  them, and a milestone or XP proposal. These are canon under the rule in `llm-wiki` where canon
  is silent; an outcome that earns nothing lists no reward row;
- each actor's closing response is written, with what it changes;
- Consequences states values, not instructions to record them later.

Every section on the page is a section of the template; none is left over from an older layout, and no card, tier, or thread label appears in the body (the card goes in frontmatter `card:`).

## Named seams

- **Chart question** → load `session-beats` for position, polarity, threads,
  or transition only.
- **The closing names a next beat type** → load that type skill for the
  handoff only.
- **A named entity (vehicle, spell, faction, lore, quest, city, region)** →
  hand off to its wiki-kind owner.

Chart assembly, polarity rules, time budget, thread planting, escalation,
recompute, and the session plan belong to `session-beats`. Spoken player text
belongs to `theatre-of-the-mind`. Other type-card catalogs load only through a
seam above.
