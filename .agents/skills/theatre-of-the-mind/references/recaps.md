# Recaps

A recap retells play that already happened. It is the story the players
would tell a friend who missed the session: the best moments, told so well
that the friend wishes they had been there, and where things stand now. Past
tense, the party as "you", each character by name when they act. Only what
play made true.

## Moments

A **moment** is something that happened at the table that the players will
bring up again: the shot that turned a fight, the bluff that worked too well,
the plan that went sideways, the line everyone repeated. Recaps are built
from moments.

1. **Find them.** An evidence packet gives the order of events; the raw
   transcript or play notes give the moments. The table marks its own
   moments: laughter, cheering, swearing, a gasp, a big roll, a line repeated,
   someone saying "that's amazing". Search the raw play for those reactions
   and read about twenty lines before each hit; the moment is what set it
   off:

   ```bash
   rg -n -i "laugh|haha|lol|oh my god|oh no|no way|holy|amazing|nat(ural)? ?(20|1)\b|crit" <raw-transcript>
   ```
2. **Rank them.** Write a private moment list before drafting: what happened,
   who did it, and how the table reacted. The biggest reactions lead. Every
   player character needs at least one moment of their own on the list.
3. **Keep the specific.** A moment is the one concrete thing that happened
   (he tried to scare off the ogre with a torch and set his own beard alight), never its
   category (she fought well, she did acrobatics, they pressed the attack).
   The category is telling; the concrete action is showing, and it is what
   the table laughed or cheered at.

Done when every big reaction in the raw play is on the list with its concrete
action, and every player character has a moment.

## Story

Build the recap around the moment list. The moments get the words; everything
between them is connective tissue that passes in a clause (you camped by the
river, the walk took two days) or drops out. An event earns a sentence of its
own only when it is a moment or the next session needs it (what the party now
carries, who is still with them). A recap that gives every event the same
weight is a **chronicle**: accurate, and nobody wants to read it.

- **But and therefore.** Link the beats by cause, never by "and then": each
  one happens because of the last (so, which meant, until) or cuts across it
  (but, just as, before anyone could). A string of short standalone
  sentences is a chronicle even when every moment is in it; a sentence that
  carries a cause and its effect is a story.
- **Each moment:** the setup, the character's choice made in their own
  style, what it caused, and the one detail that made the table react.
- **Heroics:** the risk, the choice, the payoff.
- **Comedy:** the setup, then the turn, told straight. The setup is what
  made the turn funny (the confident boast before the fall, the solemn
  speech the goat interrupted), so it gets its own sentence. The narration
  never explains the joke.
- **Dice and rules become fiction:** a critical hit is a shot that goes
  exactly where it was aimed, a failed save is a body that stops obeying, a
  spell is what it looked like from where the party stood.
- **Table lines:** a line a player or NPC actually said can be quoted word
  for word.
- **Earlier recaps** give continuity facts only; the story is told new from
  the play.
- Prep the table never reached stays out.

## Recipes

### Session recap (the recap page)

- **Job:** Retell a whole session so the players relive it and want to play
  the next one.
- **Build:** A paragraph for each movement of the session, each built around
  its moments.
- **End:** The cliffhanger as live pressure, told in the moment play stopped.

### Recap (read aloud as a session starts)

- **Job:** Remind the players what happened last session, so the table
  comes back to where they stopped.
- **Build:** Last session's events in order, one paragraph, told through the
  moments the table will remember; routine stretches pass in a clause. End on
  the spot where play stopped. Then switch to present tense for tonight's
  opening situation.
- **End:** The live pressure that starts tonight.

## Examples

Session recap:

> The ledger sent you to the Gull's Rest, and Brannoc got you through its door by announcing himself as the harbormaster's new tax assessor. He kept it up so long and so gravely that the barkeep began apologizing for the rats and poured you a round on the house. Under the cellar stairs you found Captain Morrow tied to a keg of lamp oil and gagged with her own scarf, and that was when the smugglers found you.
>
> The fight went up the stairs the hard way. Ilsa's sword stuck fast in a ceiling beam on her first swing, so she wrenched a leg off the nearest table and held the stairwell with that, and every smuggler who came up went back down faster. Tomas threw his lantern at the bald smuggler's head. It missed by a hand's width and burst across the bar, and the whole length of polished oak went up in blue flame. The barkeep stopped apologizing.
>
> When the smoke closed in, Morrow was free and coughing on the taproom floor, the bald man had a knife pressed under her jaw, and one of his crew was halfway up the burning stairs with the strongbox hugged to his chest.

The words go to the moments (the bluff that worked too well, the table leg,
the lantern), and the walk to the tavern never appears. Every character gets
a choice of their own, the comedy pays off its own setup (the apologizing
barkeep), and the page ends inside the cliffhanger.

Read aloud as a session starts:

> Last time, you followed the smuggler's ledger to the Gull's Rest, found Captain Morrow held in the cellar, and fought your way up through the taproom while the bar caught fire. The bald smuggler got a knife to Morrow's throat, and one of his crew ran for the stairs with the strongbox. Tonight, the smoke is thick against the ceiling, the stairs are burning at the bottom, and the man with the strongbox is almost at the landing.

## Final check for recaps

Run this in place of the Filing, Point, Picture, Compress, Layers, Art,
Felt, and Size items of the `SKILL.md` final check. Echo, Show, Clean lines,
Hands off, Hard lines, and Speakable (apart from its paragraph count) still
apply.

- [ ] Did the step 7 checker run with `--source` on the old recap and every
      play-evidence page, and is every copied phrase it reported rewritten?
      (Its word-count and paragraph leads do not apply to a recap.)
- [ ] Quote where each moment on the list lands: does every one appear as
      its concrete action, with more words than the routine events around
      it?
- [ ] Could each player retell their character's best moment from it?
- [ ] Does every comic moment have its setup before its turn?
- [ ] Is each beat linked to the last by cause (but, therefore), with no
      run of short standalone sentences?
- [ ] Is every rule, roll, and spell name turned into what it looked like?
- [ ] Quote the last sentence: is it inside the cliffhanger (the blade
      mid-reach, the water rising), or on where the party stands, with no
      word in it about stopping, ending, the night, or the session?
- [ ] Is every person and thing called what the players called it at the
      table (the raw transcript), with a name only where the table heard it,
      even when the DM's pages use the name?
