# Cliffhanger beats

A Cliffhanger is **a contest whose outcome is in doubt up to the very end**.
It speeds up the plot and wakes the table with a note of danger: the monster
guarding the secret is a better problem than the secret. Keep it short and
deadly, put the threat of defeat right up front, and save the best for last.
It tests what the preceding Development revealed, and its result is the
changed physical situation the next Development must deal with.

## Gates

**Session plan first.** Before reading further or loading any other skill,
find this session's filed plan (`Session-<NN>-00-*.md` in its session
folder). With none, stop here: load `plan-session` and plan with the DM;
this skill resumes from the plan's row once `session-beats` files it.

Prep only. Follow `docs/agents/work.md`. Follow AGENTS.md **HARD: entity-before-spoken** and **HARD: dm-facing-explicit**.
Cast and invent per `docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting and § Fill the silence.

## Boundary contract

- **Input:** A named Cliffhanger beat, its session-plan row (card, thread,
  escalation tier, trigger, next beat), the preceding carry-forward, and
  terrain and opposition owner pages.
- **Session plan:** the short form of the DM's intent for the session; this
  beat is written from its row (see Gates).
- **Work:** Build one Cliffhanger to the table-ready bar with the Cliffhanger
  craft below; spoken text is filled through `theatre-of-the-mind`.
- **Done:** The cold read passes and the completion test holds for every
  outcome row.
- **Capability Handoff:** Return the Cliffhanger page and its carry-forward
  per outcome. The next Development (or a Retreat or Hesitation Development
  when the outcome names one) opens from that carry-forward; a missing entry
  fact returns as a named gap.

## Copy-start

Copy `wiki/templates/cliffhanger.md`. File after accept to `wiki/journal/sessions/<campaign-slug>/<session-number>/Session-<n>-<BB>-<Label>.md`; when the request names no session, list `wiki/journal/sessions/<campaign-slug>/`, take the next session to be played, and say so. Keep the sections the template marks `Required.` and every section this Cliffhanger spends at the table; delete the rest (fact-only, `wiki/AGENTS.md` Layout). Add no section the template lacks: refiling an older page moves each old section's facts into the template section that owns them (fighter numbers and tactics into Actors, pressure into Situation or Pressure where the template has it).

## Fill a Cliffhanger

1. **Ground.** Read the preceding beat's carry-forward, the session plan row,
   and the owner pages for the opposition, place, and any item or vehicle in
   play (retrieve with `qmd`). Done when positions, conditions, resources, and
   the knowledge the party carries in are stated.
2. **Choose the card and tier.** Read
   [references/cliffhanger-cards.md](references/cliffhanger-cards.md). Pick the
   card the fiction calls for and the escalation tier this slot holds on the
   session's ladder. Name the thread under test — what the last Development
   revealed that this contest proves or disproves. The card goes in the
   beat's frontmatter `card:`, the tier in `tier:`, and the thread in the session plan's Threads
   table; the page body carries only what they produce.
3. **Cast owners.** Every creature, NPC, place, vehicle, or item the contest
   needs has an owner page before any text depends on it: cast from the wiki
   first, and mint only what nothing fits (`docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting); a creature the
   party could fight that has no owner goes to `monster-design` (its Reskin
   path fits rank-and-file: a standard statblock with this fiction).
4. **Read the bar.** Read `docs/agents/table-ready.md`, then build every
   anatomy part the contest spends, applying the Cliffhanger craft below.
   Write every DM-facing line with `writing-for-humans`: each fact on the
   page has a moment of use and one home, and what the wiki holds is embedded.
5. **Set numbers and rulings.** `encounter-prep` sets the difficulty for the
   tier and the live party; `dnd5e-mechanics` sets every check, save, and DC.
   Embed each opponent's owner statblock in `## Statblocks`
   (`![[owner#Statblock]]`) directly under Actors. Done when everyone who could fight has its
   statblock embedded, from the owner or from a proposed standard 5e
   statblock filed on the owner first.
6. **Fill the spoken layer.** Load `theatre-of-the-mind` and fill `Opening`
   to its Cliffhanger opening recipe; one `{Creature}` block per creature
   kind the party faces, titled with its name; the `_italic_` Narration cells
   in Pressure and Outcomes; and `If the session ends here`, the last words
   of the night if play stops on this beat. Delete a slot that has no spoken
   text.
7. **Write the outcomes.** Won → the next Development opens new options.
   Lost → the next Development opens with new constraints, or the opposition
   plays Retreat or Hesitation. Each outcome row states the changed physical
   situation and the carry-forward.
8. **Cold read.** Run the cold read from `docs/agents/table-ready.md` and the
   completion test. Fix every gap before filing.

## Cliffhanger craft

- **Short.** About three to five rounds of combat, or twenty to thirty
  minutes of table time for a non-combat contest. The page states the end condition, and the
  pressure makes the contest end if nobody else does.
- **Threat up front.** The danger is visible in the opening narration and
  real by round one: the opposition's first move lands, or the hazard bites.
- **Objectives beyond killing.** Each side wants something concrete — seize
  the idol, cross the bridge, drag the prisoner to the boat. The opposition's
  goes in Actors as **Wants**. Reaching an
  objective, breaking off, surrendering, or escaping each end the contest.
- **Opposition plays to win.** Every opposing side has its statblock in
  Statblocks and one tactics line in Actors: opening move, how it adapts when the party counters,
  its break point, and its exit (retreat route, escape trick, surrender
  terms). With several factions present, each has its own objective and
  ignores the party unless the party gets in its way.
- **Terrain acts.** Two or three features with rulings (cover, climb DC,
  difficult terrain, a thing that falls or burns), a **Hazard** line when
  standing somewhere hurts, and one change that lands mid-contest on a named
  trigger or round.
- **Escalate each round.** A pressure tick per round or on a named trigger
  moves the objective, narrows an exit, or adds a threat, so the contest
  sharpens instead of grinding.
- **Losing is interesting.** A lost contest changes the situation — captured,
  separated, the item taken, the route cut, the ally hurt — and hands the
  next Development a problem. Death is on the table when the fiction and the
  table's tone put it there, and the page says when.
- **One at a time.** A Cliffhanger hands off to a Development. When a request
  stacks contests back to back, write one Cliffhanger and hand off to a
  Development that makes the next contest's stakes legible.

## Completion test

The contest's result is decided by the party's tactics, choices, and rolls on
the page's rulings; every outcome row changes the physical situation; and the
page states the next beat's trigger for each row. A result fixed before the
party acts is narration — rewrite it as a contest.

Every section on the page is a section of the template; none is left over from an older layout, and no card, tier, or thread label appears in the body (the card goes in frontmatter `card:`). Each actor the party meets has its own `{NPC}` or `{Creature}` narration block, titled with its name; an NPC's block ends on their first words.

## Named seams

- **Chart question** → load `session-beats` for position, polarity, threads,
  or transition only.
- **An outcome row names a next beat type** → load that type skill for the
  handoff only.
- **A named entity (vehicle, spell, faction, lore, quest, city, region)** →
  hand off to its wiki-kind owner.

Chart assembly, polarity rules, time budget, thread planting, escalation
across the session, recompute, and the session plan belong to
`session-beats`. Spoken player text belongs to `theatre-of-the-mind`. Other
type-card catalogs load only through a seam above.
