# Session beats

A Beat Chart scripts the session's **pacing**, not its outcomes (Mike
Pondsmith, *Scripting the Game*; transcription at
`RTG-Scripting-the-Game-v1.2-agent-readable (2).md` in the repo root). Each
beat is a chunk of play that informs, entertains, and pushes the plot
visibly forward; their order keeps tension up and the story legible. Chart the
situations that reach the party on their own triggers, and prepare the
factions, clues, places, offers, and hazards that can become floating beats;
the players' answers decide how each situation turns out. **Decide the
world; leave the party's choices open**: every fact about the world is on the
page, and only the party's choices and the dice stay open.

## Gates

Prep only. Follow `docs/agents/work.md` for Work protocol and invention.
Follow AGENTS.md **HARD: entity-before-spoken** and **HARD: dm-facing-explicit**.
Cast and invent per `docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting and § Fill the silence.

## Boundary contract

### Input

Take a named session owner or session-plan request, the parent session
objective, and the bounded brief, thread map, and linked owner pages. When the
owner is a session plan, enter this skill directly; do not route through a
generic beat or orchestration skill. When the request does not yet state the DM's intent for
the session, load `plan-session` to shape it with the DM before charting.

### Owner-specific Work

Work only the named session plan: preserve its objective and live threads,
compose the Beat Chart, and apply the pacing, agency, transition, and
completion craft below. A typed beat request is a local fill, not permission to
replace the parent session objective.

### Capability Handoff

Typed slot → owning beat skill (`hook-beats`, `development-beats`,
`cliffhanger-beats`, `climax-beats`, `resolution-beats`) with session state,
slot type, planted threads, and trigger. Recompute the parent chart on return;
the child does not re-plan the session.

### Done

Session-plan artifact filed, objective preserved, typed beats linked, each
child slot resolved or explicitly blocked.

## The three chart rules

1. **Start with a Hook** — a short piece of action or suspense that pulls the
   players in. One per session.
2. **End on a Climax, then a Resolution.** The Climax is the finale; the
   Resolution is the tag line showing what the Climax changed.
3. **Alternate Developments and Cliffhangers** in the middle, never two of a
   kind in a row. Developments are non-action beats (clues, revelations,
   conversations, character turns); Cliffhangers are contests in doubt with
   physical conflict or peril (chases, fights, hazards), and a Confrontation
   carries force the opposition could use. An action Hook starts the middle with a
   Development; a cerebral Hook with a Cliffhanger. An action Climax follows a
   Development; a cerebral Climax follows a Cliffhanger.

**Budget.** One beat ≈ thirty minutes of table time; clocks and deadlines in the fiction run on world time (`CONTEXT.md`). Hook + Climax +
Resolution ≈ ninety minutes; divide the remaining time into alternating
Development/Cliffhanger slots. A six-hour night leaves four and a half hours
— about nine middle beats. The count is a ceiling, not a quota.

Why the rules hold: stacked fights numb — finishing one fight and walking into
another makes the table groan — and stacked introspection stalls. Each
Development makes the next Cliffhanger's stakes legible; each Cliffhanger
makes the next Development's information urgent.

## Plan a session

1. **Ground.** Read `hot.md`, the previous session's recap and final beat,
   the campaign hub's table aim, each PC page, and active threads, clocks,
   and factions (retrieve with `qmd`). Done when the ending state is stated as
   facts and each PC's current goal is named. Missing table aim → ask per
   AGENTS.md before treating the plan as aimed.
2. **Compass.** Write the opening situation, the immediate pressure, the
   session question, what happens if the party does nothing, and a
   one-sentence dramatic spine each beat approaches from a different angle.
3. **Opposition agenda.** Name the opposition (owner page), its goal for this
   session and how pursuing it brings the opposition into the party's path, its
   means, and what it does step by step if nobody interferes
   (the Pressure table, steps 0–4). Cliffhanger opposition comes from this
   agenda or from the environment. Done when each step names what the
   opposition does, when, and what the party can see of it.
4. **Threads.** Name three to five live threads — PC goals, faction agendas,
   mysteries, relationships under pressure, depleting resources — and for
   each, the beats where it is introduced, returns, and resolves.
5. **Chart the beats.** Fill the Beats table in play order. A charted slot is a
   situation that reaches the party on its own trigger (a clock tick, an
   arrival, the opposition's next step, the last beat's consequence), and the
   party chooses how to answer it. A situation that fires only when the party
   opts into it is a Floating Beat or a Branch. Each row: form,
   card (index below), thread, trigger, what changes, handoff, budget; each
   Cliffhanger and the Climax also get an escalation tier; each row names its
   memorable element. Add Floating Beats for situations that can fire
   wherever they fit, and Climax Candidates when more than one confrontation
   could be earned.
6. **Escalation ladder.** Assign tiers so fights rise across the night:
   Grunts → Minions → Henchmen → Villain (monsters: Scare → Fright → Horror →
   Terror). The first contest is one the party wins unless they blunder; the
   Villain waits for the Climax. `cliffhanger-beats` owns the tier ratios;
   `encounter-prep` owns the 5e difficulty.
7. **Routes and clues.** Each conclusion or access the session cannot
   progress without gets three independent routes (Critical Routes). Write
   about ten floating Clues as true, concrete facts, each revealable through
   more than one interaction.
8. **PC hooks.** Each PC gets at least one beat where their goal, bond, or
   fear drives the scene (PC Hooks), and a thread the Climax resolves.
9. **Cast owners.** List every named actor, place, item, and creature the
   beats need. Cast each from the wiki first; mint with its owner skill only
   what nothing fits (`docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting), one
   focused subtask per page type (AGENTS.md Focused minting).
10. **File the plan.** Write the plan's DM copy with `writing-for-humans` and
    file the session plan (below) before any beat page exists: it is the short
    form of the DM's intent, and every beat is written from its row.
11. **Fill the typed beats.** In chart order, hand each live slot and its plan
    row to its type skill; each beat opens from the previous beat's
    carry-forward, so the Hook fills first. Every typed beat meets
    `docs/agents/table-ready.md`.
12. **Audit and link.** Link every typed beat from the plan. Run the
    beat-order audit below and a cold read of the plan: a DM who has never
    seen the prep can say, from the plan, what starts the night, what the
    opposition does next, and which beat is on deck. Write each audit check
    into your working notes with the beats that satisfy it. Done when every
    check names its beats and every failure is fixed.

## Filed session plan

After accept, file one session plan at `wiki/journal/sessions/<campaign-slug>/<session-number>/Session-<number>-00-<Title>.md` copied from `wiki/templates/session-plan.md` with `type: session-prep` and `kind: session-plan`. The run lines under the title carry the opening situation and the current and next beat; the session question goes in frontmatter `question:`. The Beats table carries each beat's type, what starts it, what changes, and its minutes (each beat's card goes in that beat's frontmatter `card:`), with Floating Beats, Climax Candidates, Branches, and Critical Routes as `###` tables under it when they exist; then Threads, Opposition Plan, PC Hooks, Clues (floating clues), and Improv Kit. It links every typed beat page. The plan leaves Ends when, Terrain, and Checks to the beat pages and run-guide cockpits.

Done when: the plan answers those jobs, links every live beat, has `type: session-prep` and `kind: session-plan`, and a cold read of it passes.

## Composition craft

**Hook — reel in the line.** The Hook's job is to get the players involved
and moving at once; the Climax answers the question the Hook opened,
transformed by what the middle cost. Prefer an opening that grows from the
previous session's ending or an active PC goal; only this first beat recaps.

**Developments set direction; Cliffhangers test it.** Each Development is the
bump that reorients the party until the next one. Each Cliffhanger is a
contest in doubt that tests that direction and produces the changed state the
next Development interprets. Developments may chain (mentor → training →
truth); break the chain with a Cliffhanger so each piece is tested.

**Threads make a session.** Plant threads early, reveal new facets in
Developments, test them under cost in Cliffhangers, resolve them in the
Climax. A beat advancing no live thread is filler; a beat advancing an
abandoned thread is a railroad.

**Transitions are contracts.** Each beat's outcome rows are the next beat's
entry state: what changed, what the party committed to, what is now true. The
receiving beat inherits that world without teleporting past a live option,
dropping a planted thread, or contradicting what the party just lived through.

**Pressure mode.** Mystery hides information so players dig; surprise hides
the bomb until it goes off; suspense shows the bomb and the fuse. For
sustained tension install suspense: the threat visible enough to act on, the
fuse advancing without permission, the clean answer uncertain, every response
costing something.

**Earn the Climax.** Threads converge where the party's choices made one
confrontation inevitable — call it when they commit, not when the chart
reaches the slot. Recognition, early and avoided Climaxes, and simultaneous
candidates: [references/agency.md](references/agency.md) § Climax and
resolution tests.

**Show the aftermath.** One Resolution follows the Climax, scaled to it:
changed world, costs paid, each thread's final state, what the players want
next.

**Fair obstacles.** Traps and puzzles carry their clues in the scene or
earlier. Contests use transparent rolls. Betrayal and sabotage are detectable
before they are irreversible. Second Chance, Back from the Dead, and Heroes
Escape are rare, costly, and keep earlier consequences.

## Agency and recompute

Read [references/agency.md](references/agency.md) before charting and
whenever the DM reports play that changes the plan. Session-level gates:

- Prepare situations and clocks, not required outcomes.
- Offer two or more meaningful options when the fiction supports them.
- Let players ignore a Development, fail a Cliffhanger, or pursue a goal they
  create; apply visible consequences and recompute.
- Let the chart branch, re-order, or re-label when the new state warrants
  it; end early only when the session's question is answered.
- Player-facing prose is a `theatre-of-the-mind` fill inside the typed beat
  page. Sites, routes, and decision graphs → `dungeon-design`. Retrieve canon
  with `qmd`; mark silent areas and file what the user makes canon. Never
  paste WotC proprietary text.

## Beat-order audit

Before filing, write `Hook → (D/C …) → Climax → Resolution` and check:

- **Polarity:** every transition alternates; the Hook's and the Climax's key
  (action or cerebral) is the one its card catalog assigns, and the beat after
  the Hook and the beat before the Climax have the opposite type; every
  Cliffhanger puts bodies, a vehicle, or a place at physical risk.
- **Answers:** every mystery, clue, route, and opponent in the plan names its
  one concrete answer (who, what, where), proposed where canon is silent.
- **Drive:** every charted slot reaches the party on its own trigger; the
  opposition's agenda moves toward its goal whether or not the party engages.
- **Threads:** every beat advances a live thread; the Climax resolves threads
  the middle planted; the Resolution shows their final state.
- **Escalation:** tiers rise across the night; the Climax is the top tier and
  highest cost.
- **Transitions:** each outcome row gives a visible trigger for the next
  beat — no teleports, time-skips, or forced options.
- **PC hooks:** every PC has a beat and a thread that resolves.
- **Pacing:** the budget sums to the night's usable time with cushion for
  breaks and rules lookups.
