# Vehicle craft

## Craft basis

Anchor numbers on the official 5e vehicle columns (speed, crew, passengers,
cargo, AC, HP, damage threshold) and on the component model (hull, helm,
movement, weapons) used for 5e ship combat. Put the ship on the table in the
order the DM needs it: spoken look, numbers, decks and crew, how it moves and
fights. Every Statblock line carries a number; where canon is
silent, take the peer craft's figure, adjust it by the quirk, and state it as
canon under the rule in `llm-wiki`.

### Peer craft (DMG vehicle table)

| Craft | Speed | Crew | Passengers | Cargo | AC | HP | Damage threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rowboat | 1½ mph | 1 | 3 | — | 11 | 50 | — |
| Keelboat | 1 mph | 1 | 6 | ½ ton | 15 | 100 | 10 |
| Longship | 3 mph | 40 | 150 | 10 tons | 15 | 300 | 15 |
| Sailing ship | 2 mph | 20 | 20 | 100 tons | 15 | 300 | 15 |
| Galley | 4 mph | 80 | — | 150 tons | 15 | 500 | 20 |
| Warship | 2½ mph | 60 | 60 | 200 tons | 15 | 500 | 20 |
| Airship | 8 mph | 10 | 20 | 1 ton | 13 | 300 | — |

A cutter or sloop sits between keelboat and sailing ship: faster than a
merchant (3 to 4 mph under sail), smaller crew (10 to 20), lighter hull (AC 15,
HP 150 to 200, threshold 10 to 15). In combat, speed per round is roughly the
mph figure × 10 feet.

### Peer weapons (DMG siege equipment)

| Weapon | AC | HP | Attack | Range | Damage | Crew and reload |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ballista | 15 | 50 | +6 | 120/480 ft | 16 (3d10) piercing | load, aim, fire: one action each |
| Mangonel | 15 | 100 | +5 | 200/800 ft (not within 60 ft) | 27 (5d10) bludgeoning | load, aim, fire: two actions to load, one each after |
| Cannon | 19 | 75 | +6 | 600/2,400 ft | 44 (8d10) bludgeoning | load, aim, fire: one action each |

A swivel gun or deck bombard is a lighter cannon (+6, 150/600 ft, 16 (3d10)).
Ramming: the rammer and the target each take bludgeoning damage by size
(a boat 4d10, a ship 8d10, a warship 12d10), halved for the larger hull.

## Section fill detail

### Narration

Theatre-of-the-mind vehicle portrait in complete sentences: silhouette, scale,
material and wear, working parts, how people get aboard, one sound or smell.
Keep secrets, DCs, true flags, compartment contents, and unearned names out of
`[!narration]`; they live in Secrets.

### Statblock

One section holds every number: the craft's columns, then its components.

- **Size.** 5e size category and length in feet.
- **Type.** Craft class in ordinary language.
- **Speed.** Travel pace in mph and combat speed in feet per round, with mode.
- **Crew (min).** Minimum crew to sail it, and the complement carried now.
- **Passengers.** Safe passenger capacity.
- **Cargo.** Capacity in tons, for a craft that carries cargo.
- **Hull.** AC, HP, damage threshold, and what happens at 0 (sinks in N
  minutes, breaks up, drifts).
- **Helm.** AC, HP, and what is lost when disabled (cannot turn, turns only
  with a DC check).
- **Movement.** Sails, oars, or engine: AC, HP, speed lost per 10 or 25 HP of
  damage, and what stops it.
- **Weapons.** Armed craft only: each weapon's AC, HP, attack or save DC,
  range, damage, crew to fire, and reload. Omit when unarmed.

### Decks

Areas at body scale with size in feet, one usable feature each (ladder,
hatch, rigging, boom, kegs, cargo net), and who stands watch. Enough for a
boarding fight and a stowaway sneak.

### Crew

Each station names who mans it now against the minimum, the action or check it
runs, and what fails when it is empty. The captain and any officer the party
will deal with are NPC pages; rank-and-file crew are a count and a statblock
(Bandit, Guard, Veteran, Scout, Commoner, or a campaign creature page).

### Handling

One play loop for running the craft: manoeuvres, then chase and boarding.

**Handling.** Manoeuvres and conditions that change a choice: the quirk,
tacking and wind, current, reefs and shallows, tight channels, repairs
underway, noise, cover, merchant disguise. Each with Ability (Skill) or
vehicle-handling check, DC, and result.

**Chase and boarding.**
A chase runs in chase turns sized to the gap: rounds once the ships are
within a few hundred feet, minutes or ten-minute turns across a mile, watches
across open sea. Pick the unit so each turn closes or opens a real step and the
chase ends in three to eight turns. State: this craft's speed against a
typical quarry or pursuer, what closes the gap (better wind, a pilot's shortcut,
dumping cargo) and what opens it (damage to movement, reef water), the distance
at which grapples (50 ft) or boarding planks (10 ft) come into play, and the
crew's break point: when they strike colours, cut the grapples, or fight to the
last.

### Secrets

The hold, the true flag, sealed compartments, who hunts this craft and why,
and each tell's truth with how it is found (a search DC, a manifest, a talking
crewman).

### History

Ownership and rename history as world facts.

## Audit questions

- Does the identity line name the captain, and **Current voyage.** the errand,
  standing orders on meeting the party, and the next step with a time?
- Is narration sensory-only, with every truth elsewhere?
- Does every Statblock line hold a number anchored on a peer?
- Does every fighter aboard have its statblock embedded from its owner page?
- Can the DM run a chase, a boarding, and a stowaway from the page alone?
- Is every invention canon under the rule in `llm-wiki`, stated as world fact and listed in the
  response?

## Failure modes

| Failure mode | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| Empty or "Unknown" Statblock lines | Peer figure adjusted by the quirk, stated as world fact |
| A craft with no captain or errand | Name the captain; give orders and a next step |
| Secrets or DCs in narration | Move to Secrets |
| Crew as "sailors" with no numbers | Count plus statblock; captain on an NPC page |
| Chase with no distances or break point | Speeds, gap rules, grapple range, surrender line |
| One-line ferry forced into a vehicle page | Leave it on the beat or place until it is named or recurs |
| Upgrade rewrites the chassis | Keep the class; propose the upgrade on it |
| PC orders or feelings written as fact | Crew responses and consequences; choices left to play |
