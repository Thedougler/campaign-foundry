  Answer questions by searching the compiled Obsidian wiki. Use this skill when the user asks a question
  about their knowledge base, wants to find information across their wiki, asks "what do I know about X",
  "find everything related to Y", or wants synthesized answers with citations from their wiki pages.
  Also use when the user wants to explore connections between topics in their wiki, or asks a multi-hop
  "how is X connected to Y", "what links X to Y", "trace the chain from X to Z", or "what does X depend on
  transitively" question — answered by walking typed edges across multiple hops. Works from any project.
  Includes an index-only fast mode triggered by "quick answer", "just scan", "don't read the pages",
  "fast lookup" — returns answers from page summaries and frontmatter without reading page bodies.
  Accepts inline named-vault routing like "wiki-query @work what do I know about X" via the shared
  Config Resolution Protocol.

# Wiki Query — Knowledge Retrieval

You are answering questions against a compiled Obsidian wiki, not raw source documents. The wiki contains pre-synthesized, cross-referenced knowledge.

## This skill is READ-ONLY

`wiki-query` answers questions. It MUST NOT create or modify any wiki content,
including `log.md`, `index.md`, `hot.md`, or `.manifest.json`.

Never, even when a change seems obviously helpful:
- create or edit pages under `concepts/`, `entities/`, `skills/`, `references/`, `synthesis/`, `journal/`, or `projects/`
- modify `index.md`, `hot.md`, `_insights.md`, or `.manifest.json`

If the user's message contains a new finding, an action request ("save this", "ban X", "record that"), or anything implying a change, **do not perform it.** Answer the question, PROPOSE the change, and route the user to the right skill:
- quick note / gotcha → `wiki-capture --quick`
- a full new page → `wiki-capture`
- a project-knowledge sync → `wiki-update`

## Capability boundary

**Input.** A question about compiled wiki knowledge: topic lookup, filtered/public query, index-only request, or typed-edge path.

**Work.** Use the Retrieval Protocol's cheapest sufficient evidence. Deepen to focused sections or page reads only when current evidence cannot support the answer.

**Done.** Cited answer with Pages consulted and Retrieval counts. Claims supported by wiki evidence or explicitly marked as gaps/inference/conflict. No vault writes.

**Handoff.** Capture/sync requests → `wiki-capture` or `wiki-update`.


## Before You Start

1. **Resolve config** — follow the Config Resolution Protocol in AGENTS.md (inline `@name` override → walk up CWD for `.env` → `~/.obsidian-wiki/config` → prompt setup). For cross-project queries without `@name`, prefer `~/.obsidian-wiki/config` when present, even if it is a symlink to the vault `.env`. This gives `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` and any QMD variables. Works from any project directory.
2. **Load QMD settings from the resolved config** before deciding retrieval strategy. Use `wiki` when `QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION` is empty or unset, and treat QMD as available subject to the transport/tool checks below.
3. If `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/hot.md` exists, read it first — it gives you instant context on recent activity. If the user's question is about something ingested recently, hot.md may answer it before you even open `index.md`.
4. Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/index.md` to understand the wiki's scope and structure

## Visibility Filter (optional)

By default, **all pages are returned** regardless of visibility tags. This preserves existing behavior — nothing changes unless the user asks for it.

If the user's query includes phrases like **"public only"**, **"user-facing"**, **"no internal content"**, **"as a user would see it"**, or **"exclude internal"**, activate **filtered mode**:

- Build a **blocked tag set**: `{visibility/internal, visibility/pii}`
- In the Index Pass (Step 2), skip any candidate whose frontmatter tags contain a blocked tag
- In Section/Full Read passes (Steps 3–4), do not read or cite any blocked page
- Synthesize the answer **only from allowed pages** — do not mention that excluded pages exist

Pages with no `visibility/` tag, or tagged `visibility/public`, are always included.

In filtered mode, note the filter in the Step 6 log entry: `mode=filtered`.

## Retrieval Protocol

**Follow the Retrieval Primitives table in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`.** Reading is the dominant cost of this skill — use the cheapest primitive that answers the question and escalate only when it can't. Never jump straight to full-page reads.

### Step 0: GraphRAG Pre-pass (fast index query — no page reads)

Before opening any pages, query the compiled graph index:

```bash
obsidian-wiki graph-query "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" "<question>" --pretty
```

Output fields:

- **`answer_type`**: `direct` | `path` | `list` | `gap` — shapes what to do next
- **`candidates`**: top-ranked pages by title/tag/summary match + degree, with scores and summaries
- **`should_read`**: the pages most worth opening — start here instead of speculatively reading many files
- **`path`**: for multi-hop queries, the shortest wikilink path between the two concepts
- **`god_nodes_relevant`**: hub pages related to your query terms — always useful context
- **`index_only`**: if `true`, the top candidate's summary already answers the question — skip page reads

**Decision tree:**

1. If `index_only: true` → answer directly from `candidates[0].summary`. Skip Steps 1–4, go to Step 5.
2. If `answer_type == "path"` and `path` is non-empty → the connection is in `path`. Read only those pages.
3. Otherwise → open only `should_read` pages (not all candidates). This replaces the speculative 5–10 page reads the old flow required.

**Fallback** (if `obsidian-wiki` is not installed): proceed with Step 1 as normal using grep and index.md.

### Step 1: Understand the Question

Classify the query type:
- **Factual lookup** — "What is X?" → Find the relevant page(s)
- **Relationship query** — "How does X relate to Y?" / "What contradicts X?" → Find both pages, their cross-references, and their `relationships:` frontmatter blocks for typed edges
- **Path / multi-hop query** — "How is X connected to Y?" / "What links X to Y?" / "Trace the chain from X to Z" / "What does X depend on transitively?" → X and Y don't link directly; the connection runs through intermediate pages. Use the multi-hop graph traversal in Step 4b.
- **Synthesis query** — "What's the current thinking on X?" → Find all pages that touch X, synthesize
- **Gap query** — "What don't I know about X?" → Find what's missing, check open questions sections

Also decide the **mode**:
- **Index-only mode** — triggered by "quick answer", "just scan", "don't read the pages", "fast lookup". Stops at Step 3. Answers from frontmatter + `index.md` only.
- **Normal mode** — the full tiered pipeline below.

### Step 2: Index Pass (cheap)

Build a candidate set *without opening any page bodies*:

- Prefer `hot.md` + capped `qmd`/`rg` as the first filter; full `index.md` only if that fails — whole-file preload is token waste.
- Use `Grep` to scan page **frontmatter only** for title, tag, alias, and summary matches. A pattern like `^(title|tags|aliases|summary):` scoped to vault `.md` files is far cheaper than content grep.
- Collect the top 5–10 candidate page paths ranked by:
  1. Exact title or alias match
  2. Tag match
  3. Summary field contains the query term
  4. `index.md` entry contains the query term
- **Apply tier ordering within each rank bucket:** when two candidates score equally, prefer `tier: core` over `tier: supporting` over `tier: peripheral`. Read the `tier:` frontmatter field with the same cheap grep as other fields. Pages without a `tier:` field are treated as `supporting`.

**Track retrieval counts as you go (for the transparency report in Step 5/6):**
- `candidates_seen` — total distinct pages that matched *any* rank criterion above, before trimming to the top 5–10.
- `candidates_used` — how many of those you actually carried forward into Steps 3/4.
- `dropped` — `candidates_seen − candidates_used`, i.e. matches that existed but were never read. If this is non-zero, name the dropped pages (or the count if there are many) so the user knows retrieval wasn't exhaustive — this is not an error, just an honest accounting of what was left out.

If you're in **index-only mode**, stop here. Answer from `summary:` fields, titles, and `index.md` descriptions only. Label the answer clearly: **"(index-only answer — page bodies not read; facts below are from page summaries and may miss nuance)"**. Then skip to Step 5.

### Step 2b: QMD Semantic Pass (optional — defaults to `wiki`)

Use collection `wiki` when `$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION` is empty or unset after config resolution. Skip this step only when the selected QMD transport or CLI is unavailable, then proceed to Step 3.

> **No QMD?** Skip to Step 3 and use `Grep` directly on the vault. QMD is faster and concept-aware but the grep path is fully functional. See `.env.example` for setup.

Public retrieval CLI: `wiki query "<phrase>"` returns compact `title` / `path` / `id` hits. Synthesis in this skill still uses the transport below.


Choose the QMD transport from `$QMD_TRANSPORT`:

- `mcp` (default): use the QMD MCP tool configured in the agent.
- `cli`: run the local qmd CLI. Use `$QMD_CLI` if set; otherwise use `qmd`.

If `qmd query` or `vsearch` errors, qmd's local model could not load; run the same key terms as keyword search, which loads no model: `${QMD_CLI:-qmd} search "<key terms>" -c "${QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION:-wiki}" -n 8 --files`. Skip to Step 3 only when qmd itself is unavailable (no MCP tool, `qmd` not on PATH).

For MCP transport:

```
mcp__qmd__query:
  collection: <QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION or wiki>   # e.g. "knowledge-base-wiki"
  intent: <the user's question>
  searches:
    - type: lex    # keyword match — good for exact names, file paths, error messages
      query: <key terms>
    - type: vec    # semantic match — good for concepts, patterns, "what is X like"
      query: <question rephrased as a description>
```

For CLI transport, pick the command from `$QMD_CLI_SEARCH_MODE`:

Keep operator-like or punctuation-heavy tokens such as `no-sudo`, `ansible_become=false`, and `~/.local/bin` in the `lex:` line. Rewrite the `vec:` line as plain natural language without hyphenated `-term` words; QMD treats `-term` as negation, and negation is not supported in `vec`/`hyde` queries.

- `quality` (default): best relevance; slower on CPU.
  ```bash
  ${QMD_CLI:-qmd} query $'lex: <key terms>\nvec: <question rephrased as a description>' -c "${QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION:-wiki}" -n 8 --files
  ```
- `balanced`: hybrid search without LLM reranking; use when `quality` is too slow.
  ```bash
  ${QMD_CLI:-qmd} query $'lex: <key terms>\nvec: <question rephrased as a description>' -c "${QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION:-wiki}" -n 8 --no-rerank --files
  ```
- `fast`: semantic-only recall, or `search` instead when exact names, file paths, or error messages matter.
  ```bash
  ${QMD_CLI:-qmd} vsearch "<question rephrased as a description>" -c "${QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION:-wiki}" -n 8 --files
  ```

Fetch every related ranked hit in one `qmd multi-get` before citing. Snippets
are leads.

```bash
# CORRECT — comma-separated #docid values from search results
qmd multi-get "#abc123,#def456" --format md

# CORRECT — brace-expanded paths
qmd multi-get 'entities/faction/{the-passage.md,antheri.md}' --format md

# WRONG — qmd:// URIs (rejected with "File not found")
qmd multi-get "qmd://entities/faction/the-passage.md,qmd://entities/faction/antheri.md"
```

Pass `#docid` values from the query, comma-separated, or a brace glob.
`--format md`. One hit: `qmd get` with that identifier. Rejected id: serial
`qmd get`. If they still do not answer, use the ranked file list to guide
which files to grep or read in Step 3.

Fold QMD hits into the same `candidates_seen` count from Step 2 (dedupe by path — a page found by both frontmatter grep and QMD counts once).

**Defensive filter: drop any `_raw/` path from wiki-collection results.** The wiki collection is supposed to index only compiled pages, but a misconfigured collection (see `.env.example`) can end up indexing `_raw/` — including stale drafts sitting in `_raw/_archived/` that were already superseded by a promoted page. Before using a QMD hit from `$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION`, check its path: if it contains `_raw/`, discard it from the wiki-collection result set (it may still surface legitimately via `$QMD_PAPERS_COLLECTION`, cited as a raw source). This keeps a misconfigured collection degrading to "missing recall" rather than "silently citing a superseded draft as compiled knowledge." If you see `_raw/` paths coming back from the wiki collection, mention it in your working update so the user knows their collection scope needs fixing (see `.env.example` QMD section).

**Also search `papers` when the question may have source material in `_raw/`:**

If `QMD_PAPERS_COLLECTION` is set and the user is asking about a topic likely covered by ingested papers (research, theory, background), run a parallel search against the papers collection. Cite raw sources separately from compiled wiki pages in your answer.

### Step 3: Section Pass (medium cost — only if Steps 2/2b are inconclusive)

For each of the top candidates, pull the relevant section *without reading the whole page*:

- Use `Grep -A 10 -B 2 "<query-term>" <candidate-file>` to get just the lines around the match.
- This usually returns 15–30 lines per hit instead of 100–500.
- If the section grep gives a clear answer, go straight to Step 5.

### Step 4: Full Read (expensive — last resort)

Only when Steps 2 and 3 don't answer the question:

- `Read` the top **3** candidates in full. When choosing which 3 to read, apply tier ordering: read `core` pages before `supporting`, and skip `peripheral` pages unless they are the only match.
- Follow at most one hop of `[[wikilinks]]` from those pages if the answer requires cross-references.
- **For relationship queries** ("How does X relate to Y?" / "What contradicts X?"): also read the `relationships:` frontmatter block of the candidate pages. Each entry gives a typed, directional edge (`extends`, `implements`, `contradicts`, `derived_from`, `uses`, `replaces`, `related_to`). Surface these explicitly in your answer — "Page A *contradicts* Page B (typed edge)" is more useful than "Page A links to Page B".
- Check "Open Questions" sections for known gaps.
- If you're still short, **then** fall back to a broad content grep across the vault. Tell the user you escalated — this is the expensive path and they should know.

### Step 4b: Multi-hop Graph Traversal (typed edges)

Plain retrieval surfaces pages that *mention* the query terms. It cannot answer **path / multi-hop queries** — "How is X connected to Y?", "What does X depend on transitively?", "Trace the chain from X to Z" — when X and Y never appear on the same page. The answer lives in the *shape* of the typed-edge graph, not in any single page body. This is the step that walks it.

Run this step **only** for path/multi-hop queries (or when a relationship query returns no direct edge between the two pages). It is built entirely from frontmatter — never read page bodies here.

1. **Build the typed-edge adjacency (cheap).** Grep every page's `relationships:` block in one pass — `Grep -A 20 "^relationships:" <vault>/**/*.md` (frontmatter only). Each entry yields a directed, typed edge `source —type→ target`. Add the reverse direction as a traversable edge too (mark it `(reverse)`), since "connected to" is symmetric even though the typed assertion is directional. Plain body `[[wikilinks]]` count as untyped `related_to` edges only if you need them to complete a path — prefer typed edges first.

2. **Locate the endpoints.** Resolve X (and Y, if the query names two) to page paths using the registry from Step 2. If an endpoint is ambiguous, pick the `tier: core` candidate and note the assumption.

3. **Bounded BFS.** Walk outward from X over the adjacency:
   - **Max depth 3 hops** by default (the connection is rarely meaningful beyond that). Raise to 4 only if the user says "deep" / "however many hops it takes".
   - **Frontier cap:** stop expanding a node once the visited set exceeds ~60 pages — report partial results rather than fanning out across the whole vault.
   - For a **two-endpoint query** (X→Y): stop as soon as you find the shortest path; then continue briefly to surface up to 2 alternate paths if they exist.
   - For a **one-endpoint query** (X transitively): collect all nodes reachable within the depth limit, grouped by hop distance.

4. **Report the path(s) with edge types.** Show the chain, not just the endpoints — the typed edges *are* the answer:

   ```
   [[concepts/transformers]] —uses→ [[concepts/attention]] —derived_from→ [[concepts/rnn-seq2seq]] —contradicts (reverse)→ [[concepts/lstm]]
   ```

   State the hop count and whether any hop is a `(reverse)` traversal or an untyped `related_to` fallback (those chains are weaker — flag them). If no path exists within the depth limit, say so explicitly: "No typed-edge path from X to Y within 3 hops — they are in disconnected regions of the graph." That is itself a useful finding (a graph gap).

**Cost guard:** this step reads only frontmatter via grep. If the adjacency grep returns nothing (no page uses `relationships:` yet), report that the graph has no typed edges to traverse and suggest running `cross-linker` to populate them, then fall back to ordinary one-hop retrieval.

### Step 5: Synthesize an Answer

Compose your answer from wiki content:
- Cite specific wiki pages using `[[page-name]]` notation
- Note which step the answer came from ("found in summary" vs "grepped section" vs "full page read") — helps the user understand confidence
- If the wiki has contradictions, present both sides
- If the wiki doesn't cover something, say so explicitly
- **Campaign wiki facts:** retrieve from `wiki/` pages and name those pages. If the wiki does not cover the fact, say the gap. Invention is Work (`docs/agents/work.md`), not a fake wiki fact. Do not present invented material as a wiki fact.
- Suggest which sources might fill the gap

**Surface the project source path (project-scoped queries).** When the cited pages are project-scoped — their path is under `projects/<name>/...`, or their frontmatter carries a `source_path` field — resolve where the actual code lives so a proposed fix can name real files and a follow-up turn can edit them:

1. Resolve project path via `python3 scripts/manifest.py get/stats` — do **not** load whole `.manifest.json`. Prefer `.projects.<name>.source_cwd` from a targeted get if present.
2. Fallback: if the project isn't in the manifest, use the page's `source_path` frontmatter.

Include a **`Source code:`** line in the answer with that absolute path. When the query implies a code fix is wanted, name the specific files to edit using that path (e.g. `<source_cwd>/public/lib/anticheat.js`) and **offer to implement it as an explicit, separate next step** — but never edit during the query itself (see the READ-ONLY guard above).

### Step 6: Return without mutation

The query has no tracking write. Keep retrieval counts in the answer only:
`candidates_seen`, `candidates_used`, and `dropped`. Tracking and QMD
maintenance belong to the owning write skill.

## Answer Format

Structure answers like this:

> **Based on the wiki:**
>
> [Your synthesized answer with [[wikilinks]] to source pages]
>
> **Pages consulted:** [[page-a]], [[page-b]], [[page-c]]
>
> **Gaps:** [What the wiki doesn't cover that might be relevant]
>
> **Retrieval:** N candidates seen, M read, D dropped (untouched matches, if any: [[page-d]], [[page-e]])
>
> **Source code:** `<source_cwd>` — to implement, the relevant files are `…`.
> (Say the word and I'll switch out of query mode to make the change.)

The **Source code** line is optional — include it only for project-scoped queries where you resolved a `source_cwd` (see Step 5).

The **Retrieval** line is always included as the transparency report from the
counts tracked since Step 2. In index-only mode, report the counts from the
frontmatter scan; if D is 0, drop the parenthetical rather than writing an
empty list.
