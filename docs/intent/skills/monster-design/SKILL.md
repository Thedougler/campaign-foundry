  Design, tune, reskin, audit, and file monsters and creatures for D&D 5.5e
  (2024 / SRD 5.2.1): beasts, swarms, troops, minions, elites, legendary and
  solo bosses, and variants of existing creatures. Use when creating or
  improving a `type: creature` page or any part of one (statblock, difficulty
  against the live party, look, ecology, signs, weaknesses), or a named NPC's
  combat forms. Player-character builds go elsewhere.

# Monster design

In order of importance, a monster is:

1. **A fight worth having.** Its statblock threatens this party, the party
   you actually have, not the average party the Challenge Rating assumes. It
   is fun to fight, and it is flavourful, memorable, and sometimes
   terrifying. Every feature is a choice the players must answer.
2. **A real thing in the world.** It eats, nests, hunts, and leaves signs. The
   people of the setting have names for it, rules about it, and uses for its
   body. The campaign's canon shaped it.
3. **A look the table remembers.** Form follows function. Every ability shows
   on the body as a **tell**, and theatre-of-the-mind turns those tells into
   narration a sharp player can read.

File what constitution X makes canon. Follow `docs/agents/work.md`.

## Boundary contract

- **Input:** A named creature (existing page, variant, or one to mint), the
  caller's objective and brief (intended difficulty, encounter, environment),
  the live party's PC pages, `wiki/templates/creature.md`, and the vault canon
  the creature touches.
- **Work:** The steps below, for this one creature.
- **Done:** Every item in `## Done` holds for the reported page path.
- **Capability Handoff:** Every check, save, and escape DC gets the mandatory
  `dnd5e-mechanics` pass (the chassis sets the number, that skill sets the
  test). The narration goes to `theatre-of-the-mind` with the packet from
  step 7. A creature with a name, history, and personal ties is an NPC: its
  page belongs to `npc-design`, and this skill supplies the statblocks and
  encounter rule for its Combat section. The encounter it appears in belongs
  to `encounter-prep`; its lair or habitat place to `place-design`; items made
  from its body, or the item a creature disguises itself as, to
  `item-design`. A named owner the creature needs is cast before it is minted
  (`docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting): an in-play or
  unrevealed page that fits the role comes first, and its owner skill mints
  one only when none fits, before any text depends on it (AGENTS.md **HARD:
  entity-before-spoken**). Each child returns its page path or result; resume
  at the step that waited on it.

## Page rules

- **Canon.** User-said facts file immediately on the live path. Whatever the
  page needs that canon leaves silent, records as unknown, or contradicts,
  decide now as canon under the rule in `llm-wiki` (`docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Fill the
  silence): one concrete answer, stated on the page as world fact where the DM
  uses it, with the page marked `invention: true`. The response lists each
  proposal with the `[[pages]]` it grows from; a proposal that settles a
  contradiction names the sources and the reading it chose, so the DM picks the
  winner.
- **Preserve.** Improving an existing page keeps every established fact; a
  retuned number replaces the old one and the proposal names the change.
- **Bar.** Existing vault pages are canon to keep, never a quality model; many
  predate this skill. The bar is the steps and `## Done` below.
- **One callout.** `[!narration]` is the only callout. Truths, origins, and
  secrets are plain complete sentences under Behavior or Secrets.
- **Explicit DM layer** (AGENTS.md **HARD: dm-facing-explicit**). What it is,
  where it came from, and what it wants are stated by name.
- **Original expression.** Borrow patterns from published monsters, never
  their names or text. Paraphrase every rule.
- **Process stays off the page.** The party read, dossier, three-round script,
  and packet are working notes.

## Steps

[references/example.md](references/example.md) takes one monster through
every step; read it before step 3.

### 1. Read the party and the canon

**Party.** Read every PC page in `wiki/entities/pc/`, especially `## Sheet`,
`## Combat Profile`, and recent `## Log` fights. Write the **party
read** in working notes:

| PC | Level | AC | HP | Weak saves | Round-1 damage | Signature trick | Escape and mobility |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then add the party's totals: **nova** (best first-round damage, all PCs),
**sustained** damage per round, healing per round, their hard control (stuns,
banishes, grapples, walls), and what ended their recent fights too fast. When
the DM says monsters have felt soft, those fights are the evidence.

**Canon.** Retrieve before inventing (constitution XII), using QMD per
AGENTS.md § Vault retrieval. Read the creature page if it exists, every page
that links to it (`grep -rliF "[[<name>" wiki/entities` for the slug, title,
and each alias), its region, and the places it lives. Search for its prey and
predators, the factions that hunt, fear, tame, or worship it, the items made
from it, and its lore. `qmd multi-get` every related hit you will use, in one
call.

```bash
# CORRECT — comma-separated #docid values from search results
qmd multi-get "#abc123,#def456" --format md

# CORRECT — brace-expanded paths
qmd multi-get 'entities/faction/{the-passage.md,antheri.md}' --format md

# WRONG — qmd:// URIs (rejected with "File not found")
qmd multi-get "qmd://entities/faction/the-passage.md,qmd://entities/faction/antheri.md"
```

Pass `#docid` values from the query, comma-separated, or a brace glob.
`--format md`. One hit: `qmd get` with that identifier. Rejected id: serial
`qmd get`. Write the **canon inventory**: `[[slug]]` · kind · the fact that
ties it to this creature. List the other creatures in its region and the
ecological niche each one fills.

Done when every PC has a filled row, the party totals are written, and every
backlink and relevant search hit is in the inventory or dropped with a reason.

### 2. Choose the path

**Reskin** when only the fiction changes. **Variant** when one or two features
change. **Full design** when the role, decision loop, or chassis cannot be
reached either way. Write one line saying why the path is enough. A reskin
keeps its numbers, and the party read may still send it through step 5.

### 3. Make it this creature and no other

Read [references/concept.md](references/concept.md) for archetypes, diversity
axes, and weak-to-strong concepts.

1. **Stock version.** One line: "a big wolf", "a lich", "a giant jellyfish".
   Everything that line predicts is the default.
2. **Twist.** Break one rule the stock version keeps, using campaign canon.
   The lich whose phylactery is a place, not an object. The mimic grown to
   island size, wearing a paradise as bait. The hawk that lifts whales.
3. **Niche.** What it eats, where, when, and how. It fills a niche no creature
   in its region already fills, or it takes that niche differently (another
   layer of terrain, another time of day, another prey size).
4. **Form follows function.** Each signature ability comes from a body part
   or habit players can see: four wings for a rolling dive, a hum that goes
   quiet before the strike. Each striking body part does something in the
   fight.
5. **Fiction sentence.** "This is a [fantasy] [role] that [signature] to
   pursue [goal], fears [fear], and gives players [counterplay]." Then write
   Fantasy, Signature, Goal, Fear, Counterplay, and Proof, where Proof is the
   tell that makes the signature fair.
6. **Swap test.** Put a regional neighbour's name in place of this creature's
   name. Replace every line that stays true.

Done when the twist, niche, and signature all fail the swap test, meaning
each is true of this creature only.

### 4. Build the fight

Read [references/menace.md](references/menace.md). It covers what makes a
monster fun, memorable, tough, and terrifying.

1. **Difficulty target.** Standard, Hard, Deadly, or Terrifying, from the
   brief. Default to Hard for a named threat and Terrifying for a boss.
   Difficulty is set against the party read, not the CR label.
2. **Role.** One primary role; the first turn shows it.

   | Role | Function | Typical trade | Expected player response |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Ambusher | Hides, strikes, withdraws | Burst for durability | Reveal it, deny hiding, ready actions |
   | Artillery | Ranged pressure | Offense for HP or AC | Cover, close distance, disrupt |
   | Bruiser | Dangerous melee | Damage and HP for AC, speed, or saves | Kite, control, focus fire |
   | Controller | Terrain, movement, conditions | Control for direct damage | Break setup, reposition, rescue |
   | Defender | Protects allies, holds space | Durability for damage | Bypass, shove, isolate |
   | Leader | Buffs, heals, commands | Team power for personal offense | Kill or separate it |
   | Skirmisher | Moves through the party | Mobility for durability | Pin it, deny routes |

   Rank (minion, standard, elite, solo) is separate from role.
3. **Signature move.** The feature players will talk about next session. Write
   **Tell → Threat → Responses → Payoff**: the visible windup, what happens if
   ignored, at least two viable answers, and the opening it leaves.
4. **Features.** Every feature expresses the concept and asks the players a
   question. Cut any feature with no response or payoff.
5. **Escalation.** How the fight changes when it is Bloodied, when its
   signature is answered, and when it is losing: a new form, a split, a
   retreat, a desperate move. Solos and bosses need one.
6. **Morale and ending.** When it flees, surrenders, bargains, or fights to
   the death, and why.

Done when the signature move has a written tell, at least two player answers,
and a payoff, and the escalation changes the players' choices.

### 5. Set the numbers

Run [references/reference-gate.md](references/reference-gate.md), then
[references/chassis-and-budget.md](references/chassis-and-budget.md), whose
**Tuning to the party** section sets the numbers against the party read.

- **Survive the nova.** The monster shows its signature at least once against
  the party's best first round.
- **Real threat.** At Hard and above, its three-round output can drop the
  party's most exposed PC, with a telegraph they can answer.
- **Trade, do not stack.** Get toughness from action economy, phases, allies,
  and position. Stacked AC, resistances, and immunities make a dull fight.
- **Honest answers to their tricks.** Their signature tricks still work, with
  a cost or a limit that has a reason in the fiction.

Write the three-round script and run
[references/audit-and-revise.md](references/audit-and-revise.md). Send every
check, save, and escape to `dnd5e-mechanics`.

Done when the response states four figures against this party, each inside
the difficulty target: rounds it lasts (effective HP ÷ the party's damage per
round against it), rounds to drop the most exposed PC, and the CR its defense
matches and the CR its offense matches, with the statblock's label their
average; and every audit item passes.

### 6. Make it real in the world

Fill the wiki knowledge in working notes. Each ability leaves a trace in the
world.

- **Habitat:** where it lives, which places it avoids, and why; wikilink those
  places.
- **Behaviour:** its daily habits, as a DM would play them.
- **Diet:** what it eats and what feeding leaves behind.
- **Social structure:** alone, in a pair, as a pack, colony, or court; young
  and life cycle when they matter.
- **In the world:** what locals call it, how they guard against it, what they
  trade its body parts for, and which factions hunt, use, or worship it. Link
  every owner page from the inventory.
- **Signs:** for each signature ability, the trace it leaves before anyone
  meets it (tracks, kills, sheds, sounds, damage). Players can read the fight
  ahead in the signs.
- **Instincts, Tactics, Weaknesses, Aftermath:** from steps 4 and 5.
  Weaknesses are things the party can do.
- **Truth:** its origin and any secret it carries, stated plainly.

Done when every canon inventory entry is placed, and every signature ability
has a sign.

### 7. Hand the look to theatre-of-the-mind

Build the **narration packet** as fragments, each with its source:

- **Body:** body plan and size against something familiar.
- **Focus:** the feature that makes people stare, usually the twist.
- **Surface:** colour, texture, and markings, each tied to the body part that
  carries it.
- **Senses:** one sound or smell that comes off it, with its source.
- **At rest:** what it does when nothing is bothering it; its habitat in one
  clause.
- **Tells:** the visible body part or habit behind each signature ability,
  written as plain appearance ("four wings, the lower pair broad and slow,
  the upper pair narrow"), never its function.
- **Leave out:** attacks, tactics, numbers, truths, and names the players have
  not earned.

Load `.agents/skills/theatre-of-the-mind`, portrait mode, creature recipe, and
give it the packet. When the page carries Tactics, also ask for the optional
`In action` block under it (Creature in scene recipe, "you" address): how it
closes, strikes, and what each signature ability looks and sounds like when it
lands.

Done when the returned narration passes theatre-of-the-mind's final check and
contains every tell.

### 8. File the page

Copy `wiki/templates/creature.md`: a Monster Manual entry. Statblock format:
[references/statblock.md](references/statblock.md).

| Part | Carries |
|---|---|
| Narration | The portrait from step 7 |
| Habitat line | The italic *Habitat: …; Treasure: …* line |
| Statblock | At most one overview image just before the fence, then the `statblock` fence in 2024 phrasing; every rule the creature runs on |
| Campaign facts | Only what the statblock does not say, as `**Name.**` paragraphs, each only when it exists: **Tactics.** (opening, signature tell, what it does when countered, what shuts it down, when it flees), **Tracks and signs.**, **Secret.**, **Connections.**; then the optional `In action` narration |

Write complete sentences and wikilink every owner page.
Run `wiki lint <path>`, then `wiki lint fix <path>`, and rerun until green.

Then **audit**: for each item in `## Done`, write in the working notes the page
line that satisfies it, and fix the page wherever no line does. For the item
that keeps established canon, copy every sentence, list item, and table row of
the old page into the notes as its own line, and beside each write the new
line that carries it; a line with nothing beside it goes back on the page.

## Done

- The party read and canon inventory are complete.
- The twist, niche, and signature fail the swap test.
- Against this party, the three-round script meets the difficulty target: the
  response states rounds it lasts, rounds to drop the most exposed PC, and the
  defensive and offensive CR, with the label their average. The monster
  survives the nova long enough to use its signature, threatens a PC at Hard
  and above, and has an escalation if it is a solo or boss.
- The signature move has a tell, at least two answers, and a payoff; every
  feature expresses the concept.
- Every check and save passed `dnd5e-mechanics`; the statblock uses 2024
  phrasing with no hidden arithmetic.
- Every signature ability has a sign in the world and a tell in the narration.
- The narration came from theatre-of-the-mind and passes its final check;
  when the page carries Tactics, `[!narration] In action` shows it closing and
  each signature ability landing.
- `[!narration]` is the only callout; the DM layer states the truth by name.
- User-said canon is filed; every invention is canon under the rule in `llm-wiki`, marked on the
  page and listed in the response.
- Each new mint names, in the response, the candidates considered and why none
  fit (`docs/agents/table-ready.md` § Cast before minting).
- `wiki lint <path>` is green, and one done-summary names the page and what
  changed.
