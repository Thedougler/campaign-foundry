# The prose contract

Each rule below is an instruction and an example of it done right. Write toward
the examples. Nothing on this page shows prose to avoid — a bad sentence read
before drafting is easier to write afterward, not harder.

Vale checks **these same rules** once a draft exists, and the negative arrives
then, attached to the line. It is the detector, not a second rulebook: every
finding points back to an instruction here, and the fix is to go do that thing.

Examples marked *(GM)* are the GM's own prose. The rest illustrate the move only
— follow their shape, never their content.

## Sentences

- **End the sentence where the action ends.** *He set the spear and let her
  come.* No closing clause explaining why; the scene carries the reason.
- **Carry motive in the concrete choice, not in a reason.** *He took the
  garrison's smallest skiff, in the dark, three nights after he stopped
  counting.* Which boat, what hour, how long he waited — that is the motive.
- **Long sentences carry intensity through comma-linked clauses.** *(GM)* "She
  swam it on her side, one arm over, one arm hauling, his arm across her
  collarbone and her fist shut in his sleeve."
- **Fragments are for one gut-punch beat, never spread for rhythm.** *(GM)* "A
  thin sound. Almost nothing. The sound a bird makes turning."
- **Name the physical fact that reads as unnatural.** *A whisper returns as a
  chord.*
- **Earn a comparison: keep the fact when the vehicle is not more vivid.** *It
  fell into the rubble it had made.*
- **Give every visible person a handle.** *The long-hair still had both
  hands in the branded one's shirt.* A concrete noun — beard, brand, torn
  ear — not a judgment. The table can point at either without a name.
- **Treat listed facts as seeds.** *The berry split; juice ran; behind
  him the trees were already a wall.* A fact already on the parent or
  already spoken this session sits at its natural size; world texture
  lands on the expansion.
- **Leave the check in the picture.** *Where the flame finds the cut
  faces the wood goes glassy.* The next roll is already the hand on
  that object.
- **Describe what this character's body does.** *His eyes went to the door
  twice, and stayed the second time.* Where they travel, how long they stay, how
  many times they go back — no generic stranger stands in for the person here.
- **State what a thing did, once.** *The root closed over his wrist.*
- **If the narrator knows what happened, say what happened.** *The plaza emptied
  in under a minute.*
- **State it as fact.** *The birds had stopped answering each other.* uncertainty
  belongs inside a character's head, never in the narration of its own world.
- **One concrete detail beats a chain of adjectives.** *The stone took the heat
  of her hand and gave none of it back.*
- **Use words this world has.** *the drill the purple caste runs at dusk.*
- **A speaker with no name for a thing describes it harder, not vaguer.**
  *These stood as high as a boat's rail, and they came on straight instead of
  sideways.* Missing vocabulary buys more physical detail — height against
  something the listener knows, how it moved, what it did to a body — never a
  category word standing in for the creature.

## Scenes

- **Open on the concrete act.** *The counting started at the third bell.*
- **Let behaviour carry the terms.** *Two people keeping score just say numbers*
  — the reader works out that it is a contest.
- **Name what has changed since the last beat.** *The water had come up eleven
  feet since the survey.*
- **Keep every detail neutral to the outcome** until the character reaches it.
  *She checked his breathing at every rest, and at the ninth she checked it
  again.* The reader finds out when the character does.
- **Between lines of dialogue, one bare staging beat.** *He put the cup down.*
  Trust repetition and one sentence of staging to carry a confrontation.
- **One NPC addresses the party.** *The harbourmaster speaks; behind her, the
  clerk keeps counting rope.* Every other present NPC gets a clause naming what
  their hands are doing.

## Weight

- **Stay in the body and the present pressure.** *Her lungs cost her the next
  stroke, and the rope was still four feet out of reach.* What the hands are
  doing, what the lungs cost, what cannot be reached. Weight itself is
  [register.md](register.md)'s; this is the drafting reflex it asks for.
- **Use the concrete nouns of the act.** *Two prisoners plotting an escape
  whisper about fire and open water*, never about logistics.
- **Name it: what it was, when it happened, what the body did.** *At the third
  bell her hands stopped working the rope.*
- **Render a genuine unknown as the reaching.** *(GM)* "A beast? A deer, maybe? I
  don't know — something dragged him off into the forest." The failed
  identification is the character thinking on the page.
- **Never neuter a death or a wound the material states.** *(GM)* This is a
  story for adults. A kill happens on the page, in specifics: *the crocodile
  took him at the knee and rolled, and the water went pink and then quiet* —
  never a gouge in the sand, a stillness settling, a shape offscreen. Softening
  on-page violence into euphemism or absence is the same register failure as a
  timid draft, and the horror of a scene lives in the specific creature doing
  the specific wrong thing.

## Endings

- **Close on a specific fact or image, not a rhetorical shape.** *The citrus came
  in heavier that year, and nobody picked it.*
- **Land a reveal on something the reader can see and feel.** *A leash, still
  knotted to the post.* Never a category word standing in for one.
- **Cut the clause that tells the listener what the beat meant.** *They drop
  out of the sun with no sound at all and they take the eyes first.* No
  "because the eyes are soft", no "and that is why we do not land" — the
  image already did it, and the tail only takes it back.
- **Close a taboo on the act still permitted.** *A garden, to admire, from a
  distance.* The prohibition arrives inside what the listener may still do;
  spelling it out as a negation of the listener ("and not for you") flattens
  the line.
- **Show what happens and let the meaning stand.** *The water took him whole.*
  The last line of a death is the most tempting place to explain a story to its
  reader, and the one place it costs most.

## Two gates

**Gate one — the linter.**

```bash
npm run lint -- vault/stories/<your-story>.md
```

Driven to zero. Every prose check reaches the file through this one command
(`vault/refs/runbook-commands.md` § Lint).

A finding whose fix is structural — an image to rebuild, a meaning to stop
stating — is never closed by swapping the flagged word for a synonym that clears
the check. Rewrite from the instruction; the detector only located the sentence.

**Gate two — a reader that is not you.** Vale cannot see a beat that explains its
own meaning, an abstraction where an image belongs, a comparison that breaks when
checked literally, a reveal leaked early, or narration outside what the POV
knows. A draft is finished when `content-quality-checker` returns PASS on the
`narrative-prose` profile — never at a clean linter run, and never on your own
read of your own prose. Writing a draft and judging it are two jobs, and the same
writer does both badly.

## When a finding is contested

Reasoning, worked cases, and the GM's own wording live in
[banned-patterns-detail.md](banned-patterns-detail.md) — an adjudication record
that quotes bad prose to explain each rule, and never drafting material. Open one
entry when a finding is disputed. Check [prose-aesthetic.md](prose-aesthetic.md)
too: a pattern declared intentional there is never a finding.

## Adding a rule

A correction the GM makes on any piece of writing, in any task, lands the same
turn, in all three places:

1. One instruction above **with a worked example of the move done right** —
   always, including rules that also get a detector. An instruction with no
   example is a rule the next draft has to guess at.
2. A Vale rule under `docs/vale-styles/CampaignOS/`, enabled for
   `vault/stories/**` in `.vale.ini`, when the rule has a mechanical tell. Its
   message names the instruction to satisfy.
3. Its reasoning in the detail file, its provenance in
   [prose-aesthetic-source-note.md](prose-aesthetic-source-note.md).
