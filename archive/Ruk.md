# Ruk

## At a Glance

| **Role**   | Contact; bodyguard |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| **Nature** | Literal-minded [[lizardfolk]] and unshakeable guardian; impassive, observant, and not unkind. |
| **Home**   | [[warren|The Warren]] and [[le-paludi]], especially Nona's kitchen and safe house |
| **Wants**  | To protect [[nona-black-jaw|Nona Black-Jaw]] with his body and presence. |
| **Leverage** | His literal nature means he cannot ignore lies or threats he observes; he states them plainly. |
| **Limit**  | He is bound to Nona through territory, loyalty, feeding rituals, and the protection of the young. |

> **DM thesis:** Ruk is Nona's physical shield: a patient sentinel who reads threats literally and answers them with his body.

> [!narration] Ruk
> Dark olive-green scales with darker banding make Ruk large for a [[lizardfolk]], with a broad chest. Scars cover both forearms and the left side of his neck where the scales have grown back lighter and rough. He braces against the wall, both hands flat on the table in front of him, watching the doors.

## Running Ruk

### First meeting

Ruk stands watch with his back to the wall, both hands flat on the table, watching all doors. He speaks first.

> *Ruk*: “Who sent you?”
```

```col-md

### When posture changes

Ruk opens to direct statements, food offered before demands, and anyone who respects the safety of the young or the territory he guards. He closes when someone lies, threatens Nona or a protected person, or crosses him twice. He never ignores a lie or threat he observes.

He is currently guarding [[felix-aho]], a captured [[Grung]] prisoner, at the safe house. Ruk manages physical reads while [[enzo]] manages social ones. He is Nona Black-Jaw's bodyguard of twenty years and understands her through territory, loyalty, feeding rituals, and hatchling-defense.
```

### Voice

Ruk speaks in measured, flat, literal sentences with clear words. He cannot hide lies or threats and states what he observes plainly. At the table he reads the room while others see the people; Nona has used this skill for years. He gives food first, but after someone crosses him twice he stops being kind.

**The ask:** *“Who sent you?”*

**The refusal:** *“He is lying. I can smell the fear-sweat.”*

**Under pressure:** *“You threatened her. I heard you.”*

The voice-profile script remains the recording reference: [[voice-profile script]].

```

CR 6 grappler. Ruk closes and locks a target down instead of trading blows at range: **wrestler** lets him restrain or shove without losing his other attacks, while **Bite** seizes on a hit. Every attack against that target then lands with advantage.

**Pin Down** restrains a creature he's already grappled. **Hungry Jaws** lets him bite for self-healing once per rest (useful when he's absorbing a hit meant for [[nona-black-jaw|Nona]]). **Territorial Senses** means he's never caught flat-footed, and **Relentless Endurance** gives him one free save to stay on his feet if knocked down outright.
